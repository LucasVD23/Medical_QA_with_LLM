"A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for a 5-day-history of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower leg swelling. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and myocardial infarction 10 years ago. Current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, ethacrynic acid, eplerenone, and aspirin. He drinks 1 beer daily. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. He is allergic to sulfonamides. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), his pulse is 120/min, and his blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention and 3+ pitting edema in his lower legs. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The point of maximal impulse is 2 cm to the left of the midclavicular line in the 6th intercostal space. Which of the following additional findings would be most strongly associated with increased mortality?
A:Decreased BNP levels
B:Decreased serum Na+
C:Decreased QRS complex duration
D:Increased VO2
E:Increased heart rate variability
","['The pain is accompanied by dyspnea (shortness of breath), diaphoresis (sweating), and nausea. Focused History: BJ reports episodes of exertional chest pain in the last few months, but they were less severe and of short duration. He smokes (2–3 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a “typical” diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected. Pertinent Test Results: BJ’s electrocardiogram is consistent with a myocardial infarction (MI). Angiography reveals areas of severe stenosis (narrowing) of several coronary arteries. Initial results from the clinical laboratory include the following:\n\n\n\nH = High; L = Low. [Note: BJ had not eaten for ~8 hours prior to the blood draw.]\n\n\n\nDiagnosis: MI, the irreversible necrosis (death) of heart muscle secondary to ischemia (decreased blood supply), is caused by the occlusion (blockage) of a blood vessel most commonly by a blood clot (thrombus). BJ subsequently is determined to have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), also known as type IIa hyperlipidemia. Immediate Treatment: BJ is given O2, a vasodilator, pain medication, and drugs to dissolve blood clots (thrombolytics) and reduce clotting (antithrombotics). Long-Term Treatment: Lipid-lowering drugs (for example, high-potency statins, bile acid [BA] sequestrants, and niacin); daily aspirin; β-blockers; and counseling on nutrition, exercise, and smoking cessation would be part of the long-term treatment plan. Prognosis: Patients with heterozygous FH have ~50% of the normal number of functional LDL receptors and a hypercholesterolemia (two to three times normal) that puts them at high risk (>50% risk) for premature coronary heart disease (CHD). However, <5% of patients with hypercholesterolemia have FH. Nutrition Nugget: Dietary recommendations for individuals with heterozygous FH include limiting saturated fats to <7% of total calories and cholesterol to <200 mg/day, substituting unsaturated fats for saturated fats, and adding soluble fiber (10–20 g/day) and plant sterols (2 g/day) for their hypocholesterolemic effects. Fiber increases BA excretion. This results in increased hepatic uptake of cholesterol-rich LDL to supply the substrate for BA synthesis. Plant sterols decrease cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Genetics Gem: FH is caused by hundreds of different mutations in the gene for the LDL receptor (on chromosome 19) that affect receptor amount and/or function. FH is an autosomal-dominant disease in which homozygotes are more seriously affected than heterozygotes. Heterozygous FH has an incidence of ~1:500 in the general population. It is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Genetic screening of the first-degree relatives of BJ would identify affected individuals for treatment.

"A 72-year-old man with a 4-year history of Parkinson disease comes to the physician for evaluation of his medication. Since his last visit one year ago, he has had increased tremor and bradykinesia up to an hour before his next scheduled dose and sometimes feels like he does not respond to some doses at all. One week ago, he was entirely unable to move for about a minute when he wanted to exit an elevator. The physician prescribes a drug that increases the bioavailability of levodopa by preferentially preventing its peripheral methylation. This patient was most likely prescribed which of the following drugs by the physician?
A:Carbidopa
B:Entacapone
C:Ropinirole

","['Central Nervous System Disorders 1. Parkinson’s disease—The treatment of Parkinson’s disease (see Chapter 28) is often an exercise in polypharmacy, since no single agent is fully effective over the course of the disease. Most antimuscarinic drugs promoted for this application (see Table 28–1) were developed before levodopa became available. Their use is accompanied by all of the adverse effects described below, but the drugs remain useful as adjunctive therapy in some patients.', 'When patients initially take levodopa, benefits are long-lasting (many hours) even though the drug has a relatively short half-life (60–90 min). With continued treatment, however, the duration of benefit following an individual dose becomes progressively shorter until it approaches the half-life of the drug. This loss of benefit is known as the wearing-off effect. In more severe cases, patients may experience a delay in turning on (delayed-on) or no response at all to a given dose (noon). Dyskinesias tend to occur at the time of levodopa peak plasma concentration and maximal clinical benefit (peak-dose dyskinesia). They are usually choreiform in nature but can manifest as dystonic movements, myoclonus, or other movement disorders. They are not troublesome when mild, but can be disabling when severe, and can limit the ability to fully use levodopa to control PD features. In more advanced states, patients may cycle between “on” periods complicated by disabling dyskinesias and “off” periods in which they suffer from severe parkinsonism and painful dystonic postures. Patients may also experience “diphasic dyskinesias,” which occur as the levodopa dose begins to take effect and again as it wears off. These dyskinesias typically consist of transient, stereotypic, rhythmic movements that predominantly involve the lower extremities and are frequently associated with parkinsonism in other body regions. They can be relieved by increasing the dose of levodopa, although higher doses may induce more severe peak-dose dyskinesia. The cause of levodopa-induced motor complications is not precisely known. They are more likely to occur in females, younger individuals with more severe disease, and with the use of higher doses (mg/kg) of levodopa. The classic model of the basal ganglia has been useful for understanding the origin of motor features in PD, but has proved less valuable for understanding levodopa-induced dyskinesias (Fig. 449-5). The model predicts that dopamine replacement might excessively inhibit the pallidal output system, thereby leading to increased thalamocortical activity, enhanced stimulation of cortical motor regions, and the development of dyskinesia. However, lesions of the pallidum that completely destroy its output are associated with amelioration rather than induction of dyskinesia as suggested by the classic model. It is now thought that dyskinesia results from levodopa-induced alterations in the GPi neuronal firing pattern (pauses, bursts, synchrony, etc.) and oscillatory activity, and not simply the firing frequency alone. This in turn leads to the transmission of misinformation from pallidum to thalamus/cortex, resulting in dyskinesia. Surgical lesions or high-frequency stimulation might ameliorate dyskinesia by interfering with (blocking or masking) this abnormal neuronal activity and preventing the transfer of misinformation to motor systems. Current information suggests that altered neuronal firing patterns and motor complications relate to nonphysiologic levodopa replacement. Striatal dopamine levels are normally maintained at a relatively constant level. In PD, dopamine neurons degenerate and striatal dopamine is dependent on the peripheral availability of levodopa. Intermittent doses of short-acting levodopa result in fluctuating plasma levels because of variability in transit of the drug from the stomach to the duodenum where it is absorbed and the short half-life of the drug. This variability results in exposure of dopamine receptors to pathologically high and low concentrations of dopamine. It has been hypothesized that more continuous delivery of levodopa might prevent the development of motor complications. Indeed, a recent controlled study demonstrated that continuous intraintestinal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (Duodopa) is associated with significant improvement in “off” time and in “on” time without dyskinesia in advanced PD patients compared with optimized standard oral levodopa. Behavioral alterations can also be encountered in levodopatreated patients. A dopamine dysregulation syndrome has been described where patients have a craving for levodopa and take frequent and unnecessary doses of the drug in an addictive manner. PD patients taking high doses of levodopa can develop purposeless, stereotyped behaviors such as the meaningless assembly and disassembly or collection and sorting of objects. This is known as punding, a term taken from the Swedish description of the meaningless behaviors seen in chronic amphetamine users. Hypersexuality and other impulse-control disorders are occasionally encountered with levodopa, although these are more commonly seen with dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists are a diverse group of drugs that act directly on dopamine receptors. Unlike levodopa, they do not require metabolism to an active product and do not undergo oxidative metabolism. Initial dopamine agonists were ergot derivatives (e.g., bromocriptine, pergolide, cabergoline) and were associated with ergot-related side effects, including cardiac valvular damage. They have largely been replaced by a second generation of nonergot dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In general, dopamine agonists do not have comparable efficacy to levodopa. They were initially introduced as adjuncts to levodopa to enhance motor function and reduce “off” time in fluctuating patients. Subsequently, it was shown that dopamine agonists, possibly because they are relatively long-acting, are less prone than levodopa to induce dyskinesia. For this reason, many physicians initiate therapy with a dopamine agonist, although supplemental levodopa is eventually required in virtually all patients. Both ropinirole and pramipexole are available as orally administered immediate (tid) and extended-release (qd) formulations. Rotigotine is administered as a once-daily transdermal patch. Apomorphine is a dopamine agonist with efficacy comparable to levodopa, but it must be administered parenterally and has a very short half-life and duration of activity (45 min). It is generally administered by injection as a rescue agent for the treatment of severe “off” episodes. Apomorphine can also be administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion and has been demonstrated to reduce both “off” time and dyskinesia in advanced patients. However, this approach has not been approved in the United States. Dopamine agonist use is associated with a variety of side effects. Acute side effects are primarily dopaminergic and include nausea, vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension. As with levodopa, these can usually be avoided by slow titration. Side effects associated with chronic use include hallucinations and cognitive impairment. Sedation with sudden unintended episodes of falling asleep while driving a motor vehicle have been reported. Patients should be informed about this potential problem and should not drive when tired. Dopamine agonists can also be associated with impulse-control disorders, including pathologic gambling, hypersexuality, and compulsive eating and shopping. The precise cause of these problems, and why they appear to occur more frequently with dopamine agonists than levodopa, remains to be resolved, but reward systems associated with dopamine and alterations in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal regions have been implicated. In general, chronic side effects are dose-related and can be avoided or minimized with lower doses. Injections of apomorphine and patch delivery of rotigotine can be complicated by development of skin lesions at sites of administration. Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) block central dopamine metabolism and increase synaptic concentrations of the neurotransmitter. Selegiline and rasagiline are relatively selective suicide inhibitors of the MAO-B enzyme. Clinically, MAO-B inhibitors provide antiparkinsonian benefits when used as monotherapy in early disease and reduced “off” time when used as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with motor fluctuations. MAO-B inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated. They may increase dyskinesia in levodopa-treated patients, but this can usually be controlled by down-titrating the dose of levodopa. Inhibition of the MAO-A isoform prevents metabolism of tyramine in the gut, leading to a potentially fatal hypertensive reaction known as a “cheese effect” because it can be precipitated by foods rich in tyramine such as some cheeses, aged meats, and red wine. Selegiline and rasagiline do not functionally inhibit MAO-A and are not associated with a 2615 cheese effect with doses typically used in clinical practice. There are theoretical risks of a serotonin reaction in patients receiving concomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, but these are rarely encountered. Interest in MAO-B inhibitors has also focused on their potential to have disease-modifying effects. MPTP toxicity can be prevented experimentally by coadministration of an MAO-B inhibitor that blocks its conversion to the toxic pyridinium ion MPP+. MAO-B inhibitors also have the potential to block the oxidative metabolism of dopamine and prevent oxidative stress. In addition, both selegiline and rasagiline incorporate a propargyl ring within their molecular structure that provides antiapoptotic effects in laboratory models. The DATATOP study showed that selegiline significantly delayed the time until the emergence of disability, necessitating the introduction of levodopa, in untreated PD patients. However, it could not be determined whether this was due to a neuroprotective effect that slowed disease progression or a symptomatic effect that merely masked ongoing neurodegeneration. More recently, the ADAGIO study demonstrated that early treatment with rasagiline 1 mg/d, but not 2 mg/d, provided benefits that could not be achieved when treatment with the same drug was initiated at a later time point, consistent with a disease-modifying effect; however, the long-term significance of these findings is uncertain. When levodopa is administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor, it is primarily metabolized in the periphery by COMT. Inhibitors of COMT increase the elimination half-life of levodopa and enhance its brain availability. Combining levodopa with a COMT inhibitor reduces “off” time and prolongs “on” time in fluctuating patients while enhancing motor scores. Two COMT inhibitors have been approved, tolcapone and entacapone. There is also a combination tablet of levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone (Stalevo). Side effects of COMT inhibitors are primarily dopaminergic (nausea, vomiting, increased dyskinesia) and can usually be controlled by down-titrating the dose of levodopa by 20–30%. Severe diarrhea has been described with tolcapone, and to a lesser degree with entacapone, and necessitates stopping the medication in 5–10% of individuals. Cases of fatal hepatic toxicity have been reported with tolcapone, and periodic monitoring of liver function is required. This problem has not been encountered with entacapone. Discoloration of urine can be seen with both COMT inhibitors due to accumulation of a metabolite, but it is of no clinical concern. It has been proposed that initiating levodopa in combination with a COMT inhibitor to enhance its elimination half-life could provide more continuous levodopa delivery if administered at frequent intervals and reduce the risk of motor complications. While this result has been demonstrated in a preclinical MPTP model, and continuous infusion reduces both “off” time and dyskinesia in advanced PD patients, no benefit of initiating levodopa with a COMT inhibitor compared to levodopa alone was detected in early PD patients in the STRIDE-PD study. This may have been because the combination was not administered at frequent enough intervals to provide continuous levodopa availability. For now, the main value of COMT inhibitors continues to be in patients who experience motor fluctuations. Centrally acting anticholinergic drugs such as trihexyphenidyl and benztropine were used historically for the treatment of PD, but they lost favor with the introduction of dopaminergic agents. Their major clinical effect is on tremor, although it is not certain that this benefit is superior to what can be obtained with agents such as levodopa and dopamine agonists. Still, they can be helpful in individual patients with severe tremor. Their use is limited particularly in the elderly, due to their propensity to induce a variety of side effects including urinary dysfunction, glaucoma, and particularly cognitive impairment.

With disease progression, dopaminergic therapy becomes necessary. This can conveniently be initiated with a dopamine agonist, either alone or in combination with low-dose carbidopa-levodopa therapy, unless risk factors for impulse control disorders are present. Alternatively, especially in older patients, a dopamine agonist can be omitted and the patient started immediately on carbidopa-levodopa, which is the most effective symptomatic treatment of the motor disturbances of parkinsonism. Physical therapy is helpful in improving mobility. In patients with severe parkinsonism and long-term complications of levodopa therapy such as the on-off phenomenon, a trial of treatment with the newer extended-release formulation of carbidopa-levodopa (Rytary), a COMT inhibitor, or rasagiline may be helpful.

Some patients become less responsive to levodopa, perhaps because of loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal nerve terminals or some pathologic process directly involving striatal dopamine receptors. For such reasons, the benefits of levodopa treatment often begin to diminish after about 3 or 4 years of therapy, regardless of the initial therapeutic response. Although levodopa therapy does not stop the progression of parkinsonism, its early initiation lowers the mortality rate. However, long-term therapy may lead to a number of problems in management such as the on-off phenomenon discussed below. The most appropriate time to introduce levodopa therapy must therefore be determined individually.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0

It is a common problem in children and has many causes. Vomiting should be distinguished from regurgitation of stomach contents, also known as gastroesophageal reflux (GER), chalasia, or “spitting up.” Although the end result of vomiting and regurgitation is similar, they have completely different characteristics. Vomiting is usually preceded by nausea and is accompanied by forceful gagging and retching. Regurgitation, on the other hand, is effortless and not preceded by nausea.

Kaye, Kenneth M. Kaye purpuric, ulcerated, or with eschars. Diseases are listed by these cat-\n\n\n\nThe acutely ill patient with fever and rash may present a diagnostic challenge for physicians. However, the distinctive appearance of an eruption in concert with a clinical syndrome can facilitate a prompt diagnosis and the institution of life-saving therapy or critical infection-control interventions. Representative images of many of the rashes discussed in this chapter are included in Chap. 25e. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:\n\n\n\nA thorough history of patients with fever and rash includes the following relevant information: immune status, medications taken within the previous month, specific travel history, immunization status, exposure to domestic pets and other animals, history of animal (including arthropod) bites, recent dietary exposures, existence of cardiac abnormalities, presence of prosthetic material, recent exposure to ill individuals, and exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. The history should also include the site of onset of the rash and its direction and rate of spread. A thorough physical examination entails close attention to the rash, with an assessment and precise definition of its salient features. First, it is critical to determine what type of lesions make up the eruption. Macules are flat lesions defined by an area of changed color (i.e., a blanchable erythema). Papules are raised, solid lesions <5 mm in diameter; plaques are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a flat, plateau-like surface; and nodules are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a more rounded configuration. Wheals (urticaria, hives) are papules or plaques that are pale pink and may appear annular (ringlike) as they enlarge; classic (nonvasculitic) wheals are transient, lasting only 24 h in any defined area. Vesicles (<5 mm) and bullae (>5 mm) are circumscribed, elevated lesions containing fluid. Pustules are raised lesions containing purulent exudate; vesicular processes such as varicella or herpes simplex may evolve to pustules. Nonpalpable purpura is a flat lesion that is due to bleeding into the skin. If <3 mm in diameter, the purpuric lesions are termed petechiae; if >3 mm, they are termed ecchymoses. Palpable purpura is a raised lesion that is due to inflammation of the vessel wall (vasculitis) with subsequent hemorrhage. An ulcer is a defect in the skin extending at least into the upper layer of the dermis, and an eschar (tâche noire) is a necrotic lesion covered with a black crust. Other pertinent features of rashes include their configuration (i.e., annular or target), the arrangement of their lesions, and their distribution (i.e., central or peripheral).', ""D.

Some of our own patients, as mentioned above, have also had a flaccid paraplegia as a result of infiltration of the cauda roots; this peripheral involvement has been commented on by other authors. Only a few patients will have nodular or multiple infiltrative pulmonary lesions, skin lesions, or adenopathy; almost all of our cases were restricted to the brain and spinal cord, but other reports suggest systemic disease in a high proportion, including infiltration of the adrenal glands. MRI shows multiple nodular or variegated abnormalities on T2-weighted images throughout the white matter of the brain; most lesions are enhanced by gadolinium, and some demonstrate restricted diffusion resulting from microvascular occlusion and infarction. In one of the cases we studied there were numerous hemorrhagic lesions.', 'Neurologic sequelae occur with CNS disease, and the mortality risk is significant. MRI results may be normal. Identified lesions (solitary or multifocal) are usually T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense and may enhance with gadolinium.

Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): The physical examination was remarkable for AK’s emaciated appearance. (His body mass index was later determined to be 17.5, which put him in the underweight category.) His facial cheeks were erythematous (red in color) due to dilated blood vessels in the skin (telangiectasia). Eye movement was normal. Neither icterus (jaundice) nor edema (swelling due to fluid retention) was seen. The liver was slightly enlarged. Bedside tests revealed hypoglycemia and hyperketonemia (as acetoacetate). Blood was drawn and sent to the clinical laboratory. Pertinent Test Results:\n\n\n\nDUI = driving under the influence; H = High; L = Low. Additional Tests: Complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear revealed a macrocytic anemia (see right image). Folate and B12 levels were ordered. Diagnosis: AK is diagnosed with alcoholism. Treatment (Immediate): Thiamine and glucose were given intravenously. Prognosis: Alcoholism (alcohol dependence) is the third most common cause of preventable death in the United States. People with alcoholism are at increased risk for liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and some cancers. Nutrition Nugget: Those with alcoholism are at risk for vitamin deficiencies as a result of decreased intake and absorption. Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency is common and can have serious consequences such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome with its neurologic effects. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the coenzyme form, is required for the dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation of α-keto acids (such as pyruvate) as well as the transfer of two-carbon ketol groups by transketolase in the reversible sugar interconversions in the pentose phosphate pathway. Genetics Gem: Acetaldehyde, the product of ethanol oxidation by the hepatic, cytosolic, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-requiring enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), is oxidized to acetate by the mitochondrial, NAD+-requiring aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). The majority of individuals of East Asian (but not European or African) heritage have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that renders ALDH2 essentially inactive.

No matter how high the drug concentration goes, a point will be reached beyond which no further increment in response is achieved. If increasing the dose in a particular patient does not lead to a further clinical response, it is possible that the maximum effect has been reached. Recognition of maximum effect is helpful in avoiding ineffectual increases of dose with the attendant risk of toxicity. B. Sensitivity\n\n\n\nThe sensitivity of the target organ to drug concentration is reflected by the concentration required to produce 50% of maximum effect, the C50. Diminished sensitivity to the drug can be detected by measuring drug concentrations that are usually associated with therapeutic response in a patient who has not responded. This may be a result of abnormal physiology—eg, hyperkalemia diminishes responsiveness to digoxin—or drug antagonism—eg, calcium channel blockers impair the inotropic response to digoxin. Increased sensitivity to a drug is usually signaled by exaggerated responses to small or moderate doses. The pharmacodynamic nature of this sensitivity can be confirmed by measuring drug concentrations that are low in relation to the observed effect. CHAPTER 3 Pharmacokinetics & Pharmacodynamics: Rational Dosing & the Time Course of Drug Action\n\n\n\nClearance is the single most important factor determining drug concentrations. The interpretation of measurements of drug concentrations depends on a clear understanding of three factors that may influence clearance: the dose, the organ blood flow, and the intrinsic function of the liver or kidneys. Each of these factors should be considered when interpreting clearance estimated from a drug concentration measurement. It must also be recognized that changes in protein binding may lead the unwary to believe there is a change in clearance when in fact drug elimination is not altered (see Box: Plasma Protein Binding: Is It Important?). Factors affecting protein binding include the following: 1. Albumin concentration: Drugs such as phenytoin, salicylates, and disopyramide are extensively bound to plasma albumin. Albumin levels are low in many disease states, resulting in lower total drug concentrations. 2. Alpha1-acid glycoprotein concentration: α1-Acid glycoprotein is an important binding protein with binding sites for drugs such as quinidine, lidocaine, and propranolol. It is increased in acute inflammatory disorders and causes major changes in total plasma concentration of these drugs even though drug elimination is unchanged.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['C.

Pharmacodynamic principles can be used to predict the concentration required to achieve a particular degree of therapeutic effect.

"Patient 1 – A 26-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for an annual exam. She currently does not have any acute concerns and says her health has been generally well. Medical history is significant for asthma, which is managed with an albuterol inhaler. Her last pap smear was unremarkable. She is currently sexually active with one male and consistently uses condoms. She occasionally smokes marijuana and drinks wine once per week. Her mother recently passed away from advanced ovarian cancer. Her sister is 37-years-old and was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Physical examination is remarkable for a mildly anxious woman.

Patient 2 – A 27-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for an annual exam. She says that she would like to be screened for breast cancer since two of her close friends were recently diagnosed. She noticed she has a small and mobile mass on her left breast, which increases in size and becomes tender around her time of menses. Family history is remarkable for hypertension in the father. The physical exam is significant for a small, well-defined, and mobile mass on her left breast that is not tender to palpation.

Controversies in breast cancer screening strategies. J Natl Compr Canc Netw.', 'Grube Armando E. Giuliano\n\n\n\nEarly detection of breast cancer is improved by risk assessment, clinical breast examination, screening mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging in selected patients. Triple-test concordance requires agreement between results of clinical breast examination, breast imaging, and tissue diagnosis. In the absence of concordance, further diagnostic intervention is required. The most common benign breast problems include fibrocystic changes and mastalgia. These problems are usually best treated by reassurance. Pharmaceutic agents are available but have side effects that usually are not well tolerated. Histologic differences exist between fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors; phyllodes tumors require excision, whereas small asymptomatic fibroadenomas can be observed if the diagnosis is confirmed by histologic or cytologic assessment and there is no evidence of growth. Spontaneous, unilateral, bloody discharge requires histologic evaluation to exclude malignancy, but symptoms usually are caused by a benign process such as intraductal papilloma or duct ectasia. Breast abscesses are managed with fine needle aspiration and antibiotics; the use of incision and drainage is reserved for recurrence. Benign breast diseases are among the most common diagnoses that the busy obstetrician-gynecologist will see in practice. An ability to accurately and promptly diagnose both benign and malignant breast diseases is within the purview of the practicing gynecologist (1). Benign breast disease is a complex entity with a range of physiologic changes and clinical manifestations that have an impact on a woman’s health independent of breast cancer risk (2). History Evaluation of a new breast symptom begins with assessment of symptoms based on a thorough clinical history (3). The history should include questions regarding current symptoms, duration of the condition, ﬂuctuation of the signs and symptoms, and factors that aggravate or relieve the symptom. Assessment of breast problems should focus on the following points:\n\n\n\nNipple discharge  Characteristics of discharge (spontaneous or nonspontaneous, appearance, unilat eral or bilateral, single or multiple duct involvement)  Breast mass (size and change in size, density, or texture)  Breast pain (cyclic versus continuous)  Association of symptoms with menstrual cycle  Change in breast shape, size, or texture  Previous breast biopsies  History of breast trauma\n\n\n\nThe patient should be questioned about the following risk factors for breast cancer (see Chapter 40 for more details):\n\n\n\nIncreasing age (approximately 50% of breast cancers occur after age 65)  Age of menarche less than 12 years  Nulliparity or first pregnancy at greater than 30 years of age  Late menopause (older than 55 years of age)  Family history of breast cancer (especially premenopausal or bilateral disease)  Number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer and their ages when diagnosed  Family history of male breast cancer  Inherited conditions associated with a high risk for breast cancer, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden’s disease, ataxia telangiectasia syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome  Other malignancies (ovary, colon, and prostate)  Pathology of previous breast biopsy showing atypia or lobular or ductal carcinoma\n\n\n\nHormone therapy  Alcohol consumption  Postmenopausal weight gain  Personal history of breast cancer\n\n\n\nBreast cancer risk can be determined by the Gail Risk assessment model, which is available electronically (4). The Gail Risk assessment model calculates risk based on patient race, age, age of menarche, age of first live birth, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of previous breast biopsies, and presence of atypia on the biopsy. It is important to obtain a current list of medications used, including hormone therapy and herbal medications such as phytoestrogens. The gestational history should take into consideration the possibility that the patient may be pregnant or has a prior history of miscarriage or abortion. A personal history of exposure to radiation, especially in the treatment of childhood malignancies, is associated with a higher incidence of developing breast cancer (5). The goal of breast evaluation is to determine clearly whether the symptom represents a benign breast condition or may be indicative of a neoplastic process. Physical Examination Breast tumors, particularly cancerous ones, usually are asymptomatic and are discovered by the patient or through physical examination or screening mammography. Typically, the breast changes slightly during the menstrual cycle. During the premenstrual phase, most women have increased innocuous nodularity and mild engorgement of the breast. Rarely these characteristics can obscure an underlying lesion and make examination difficult. Findings should be carefully documented in the medical record to serve as a baseline for future reference. Inspection Inspection is performed initially while the patient is seated comfortably with her arms relaxed at her sides. The breasts are compared for symmetry, contour, and skin appearance. Edema or erythema is identified easily, and skin dimpling or nipple retraction is shown by having the patient raise her arms above her head and then press her hands on her hips, thereby contracting the pectoralis muscles (Fig. 21.1). Palpable and even nonpalpable tumors that distort Cooper’s ligaments may lead to skin dimpling with these maneuvers. Figure 21.1 Raising the arm reveals retraction of the skin of the lower outer quadrant caused by a small palpable carcinoma. (From Kruper L, Giuliano AE. Breast disease. In: Berek JS, Hacker NF, eds. Berek & Hacker’s Gynecologic Oncology, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2010:615, with permission.)\n\n\n\nPalpation While the patient is seated, each breast should be palpated methodically. Some physicians recommend palpating the breast in long strips, but the exact palpation technique used is probably not as important as the thoroughness of its application over the entire breast. One very effective method is to palpate the breast in enlarging concentric circles until the entire breast is covered. A pendulous breast can be palpated by placing one hand between the breast and the chest wall and gently palpating the breast between both examining hands. The axillary and supraclavicular areas should be palpated for enlarged lymph nodes. The entire axilla, the upper outer quadrant of the breast, and the axillary tail of Spence are palpated for possible masses. While the patient is supine with one arm over her head, the ipsilateral breast is again methodically palpated from the clavicle to the costal margin and from the sternum to the latissimus dorsi laterally. If the breast is large, a pillow or towel may be placed beneath the scapula to elevate the side being examined; otherwise, the breast tends to fall to the side, making palpation of the lateral hemisphere more difficult. The major features to be identified on palpation of the breast are temperature, texture and thickness of skin, generalized or focal tenderness, nodularity, density, asymmetry, dominant masses, and nipple discharge. Most premenopausal patients have normally nodular breast parenchyma. The nodularity is diffuse but predominantly in the upper outer quadrants, where there is more breast tissue. These benign parenchymal nodules are small, similar in size, and indistinct. By comparison, breast cancer usually occurs in the form of a nontender, firm mass with irregular margins. A cancerous mass feels distinctly different from the surrounding nodularity. A malignant mass may be fixed to the skin or to the underlying fascia. A suspicious mass is usually unilateral. Similar findings in both breasts are unlikely to represent malignant disease (6). Breast Self-Examination There is controversy about recommending breast self-examination (BSE). There is no evidence that doing BSE improves survival rates from breast cancer (7). Staunch opponents of BSE argue that it doubles a woman’s risk of undergoing a breast biopsy for benign pathology (8). BSE increases breast health awareness and helps promote early detection of cancer (9–11). Most breast cancers are detected by women themselves (48%), followed by breast imaging (41%), and by physician clinical examination in only 11% (12). Although young women have a low incidence of breast cancer, it is important to teach BSE early so it becomes habitual. Organizations such as the American Cancer Society sponsor courses in BSE. Reassurance, support, and patient education may encourage women to overcome psychological barriers to routine BSE (13). Such instruction is available through electronic resources (14). The following seven “P”s represent the essential components of breast examination:\n\n\n\nPads of fingers for palpation\n\n\n\nPattern of search\n\n\n\nThe woman should inspect her breasts while standing or sitting before a mirror, looking for any asymmetry, skin dimpling, or nipple retraction. Elevating her arms over her head or pressing her hands against her hips to contract the pectoralis muscles will highlight any skin dimpling. Finally, the woman should examine her breasts while bending over and leaning forward. While standing or sitting, she should carefully palpate her breasts with the fingers of the opposite hand. She should lie down and again palpate each quadrant of the breast as well as the axilla using the pads of the three middle fingers with three pressures—light, medium, and deep—covering the entire breast from the clavicle to the inframammary fold, from sternum to latissimus dorsi laterally. The area within the perimeter of the breast should be palpated, preferably using an up-and-down method called vertical stripe, rather than the concentric circular or radial methods, in which the edges of the breast tissue often are omitted. Many women feel anxious about performing breast examination. The examination may be performed while showering; soap and water may increase the sensitivity of palpation, and the privacy of the shower may provide a less anxiety-provoking environment. It is helpful for all women to examine their breasts at the same time each month to develop a routine. Premenopausal women should examine their breasts monthly 7 to 10 days after the onset of the menstrual cycle. For postmenopausal women, selection of a specific calendar date is a helpful way to remember to perform a monthly BSE. Women should be instructed to report any abnormalities or changes to their physicians. If the physician cannot confirm the patient’s findings, the examination should be repeated in 1 month or after her next menstrual period. Mammography Screen-film mammography was considered the best method for imaging the breast (15). Full-field digital mammography, which records mammographic images on a computer, is a modification of screen-film mammography (16). Some advantages of digital mammography include lower radiation exposure, ability to manipulate a computerized image for optimal viewing, and access to distance consultations through telemammography (17). Studies comparing the sensitivity of full-field digital mammography with screen-film mammography in detecting cancer had mixed results. The Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST) consisted of 49,528 asymptomatic women presenting for screening mammography, who underwent both digital and film mammography. Results suggested that while the overall accuracy of digital and film mammography for screening breast cancer is similar, digital mammography may be more accurate in women under the age of 50 years, women with radiographically dense breast, and premenopausal or perimenopausal women (18). Slow-growing breast cancers can be identified by mammography at least 2 years before the mass reaches a size detectable by palpation. These tumors have a less aggressive biologic behavior than interval breast cancers (19–21). Mammography is the only reproducible method of detecting nonpalpable breast cancer, but its use depends on the availability of state-of-the-art equipment and a dedicated breast radiologist. Compression of the breast is necessary to obtain good images, and patients should be forewarned that breast compression is uncomfortable. With good technique and well-maintained modern equipment, exposure to radiation can be limited. Full-field digital mammography (FFDM) has a 22% lower mean glandular radiation dose than film-screen mammography per acquired view. FFDM delivers 1.86 mGy average breast radiation dose per view compared to 2.37 mGy for film screen (22). The indications for mammography are as follows: 1. To screen, at regular intervals, women who are at high risk for developing breast cancer. About one-third of the abnormalities detected on screening mammography prove malignant when biopsy is performed (23). 2. To evaluate a questionable or ill-defined breast mass or other suspicious change in the breast that is detected by clinical breast examination. 3. To establish a baseline breast mammogram and reevaluate patients at yearly intervals to diagnose a potentially curable breast cancer before it has been diagnosed clinically. 4. To search for occult breast cancer in a patient with metastatic disease in axillary nodes or elsewhere from an unknown primary origin. 5. To screen for unsuspected cancer before cosmetic operations or biopsy of a mass. 6. To monitor breast cancer patients who were treated with a breast-conserving surgery and radiation. Screening programs to evaluate asymptomatic, healthy women combine physical examination with mammographic screening to identify breast abnormalities. During the past 30 years, there was an increase in the use of mammography, mammographic screening, and public awareness of breast health care. The cancer detection rate for screening mammography is 5 per 1,000 screening examinations (24). The cancer detection rate is 11-fold higher, at 55 per 1,000 examinations, when breast imaging is performed for a specific finding (i.e., diagnostic imaging) (24). Of seven randomized mammographic screening trials performed, five demonstrated a reduction in overall mortality from breast cancer screening programs (25–32). A study from the Rhode Island Cancer Registry indicates that the institution of population-based breast cancer screening programs can result in the reduction in the median tumor size at initial detection from 2.0 to 1.5 cm, which is associated with a 25% reduction in mortality (33). A study from the Norwegian breast-cancer screening program was associated with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of total reduction (30). Detecting breast cancer before it spreads to the axillary nodes greatly increases the chance of survival; about 85% of women with such cancer will survive at least 5 years (31,34). Because breast cancer presents first as local disease, screening mammography for breast cancer in asymptomatic women can detect small tumors and offer a better prognosis. These tumors had less opportunity to metastasize regionally or systemically; thus women have more options for treatment with reduced toxicity. The American Cancer Society published an extensive review of the benefits, limitations, and potential harms of screening mammography (35). It addresses the role of physical examination, discusses screening in older and high-risk women, and reviews the role of newer technologies. A summary of the guidelines recommends that women of average risk for breast cancer begin mammographic screening at age 40. The rationale for beginning mammographic screening at age 40 is a 24% reduction in mortality in screened populations (28). For women in their 20s and 30s, a clinical breast examination is suggested at least every 3 years, and preferably annually, as part of a well-woman examination. For women older than age 40 years, annual clinical breast examination and mammography are recommended. For older women, recommendations for mammographic screening may be individualized based on the presence of any comorbidities. Chronologic age alone should not be considered a contraindication to mammographic screening as long as a woman is in reasonable health and would be a candidate for breast cancer surgery (35). The American Geriatrics Society recommends annual or at least biennial mammography for women up to age 75 years, and after that age, every 2 to 3 years if the woman has a life expectancy of more than 4 years (36). The reasons for liberalization of the screening interval recommendations for older women include improved biology profile, slower growth rate, and lower risk for recurrence (37–41). The natural history of the disease in older women must be balanced against life expectancy as a function of overall health (42). For high-risk women, consideration can be given to earlier initiation of screening (5 to 10 years earlier than the age of the index case) and shorter intervals between screening, and the use of additional imaging modalities such as breast ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with dedicated breast coils. No screening test is perfect, and false-negative imaging studies or benign clinical examinations may lead the patient to an erroneous sense of well-being only to be confronted later with a subsequent cancer. Likewise, a false-positive result can lead to significant anxiety and unnecessary biopsy. A mammographic abnormality includes a mass (solid versus cystic), microcalcifications (benign, indeterminate, suspicious), asymmetric density, architectural distortion, and appearance of a new density. There are eight morphologic categories of mammographic abnormalities (43,44): 1. 2. Number of calcifications 3. Description of calcifications 4. 5. Shape of mass 6. Density of mass 7. 8. Mammographic abnormalities should be visible on two views, usually craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO). The lesion should triangulate to the same location on those two views. Calcifications can be macrocalcifications, which are coarse and usually represent benign degenerative breast conditions. Calcifications associated with breast cancer are clustered pleomorphic microcalcifications; typically five to eight or more calcifications are aggregated in one part of the breast (45). These calcifications may be associated with a mammographic mass density. A mass density may appear without evidence of calcifications. It can represent a cyst, benign tumor, or a malignancy. A malignant density usually has irregular or ill-defined borders and may lead to architectural distortion, which may be subtle and difficult to detect in a dense breast. Other mammographic findings suggesting breast cancer are architectural distortion, asymmetric density, skin thickening or retraction, or nipple retraction. Examples of mammographic abnormalities can be found in several electronic sources (46). The American College of Radiology recommended the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as a standardized scheme for describing mammographic lesions (47). In the BI-RADS system, there are six categories for mammographic findings (other than incomplete) (43,44). 0. Incomplete, needs further imaging 1. 2. 3. Probably benign, short-interval follow-up recommended 4. 5. Highly suggestive of malignancy and appropriate action should be undertaken 6. Known malignancy (a category that is often used for follow-up of a lesion that is undergoing neoadjuvant treatment)\n\n\n\nThe patient should be referred for tissue diagnosis if the report identifies a lesion as a category 4 or 5 (47). A category 0 indicates incomplete evaluation, and further diagnostic studies are required. Category 3 connotes a finding that is most likely benign; a short-interval follow-up is recommended, and breast examination by an expert should be considered. Correlation of Findings\n\n\n\nBiopsy must be performed on patients with a dominant or suspicious mass despite absence of mammographic findings (48). Mammography should be performed before biopsy so other suspicious areas can be noted and the contralateral breast can be checked (Fig. 21.2). Mammography is never a substitute for biopsy because it may not reveal clinical cancer, especially when it occurs in the dense breast tissue of young women with fibrocystic changes. The sensitivity of mammography is 75%, with a specificity of 92.3% depending on the patient’s age; breast density; use of hormone therapy; and the size, location, and mammographic appearance of the tumor (49). Mammography is less sensitive in young women with dense breast tissue than in older women, who tend to have fatty breasts, in which mammography can detect at least 90% of malignancies (50). Small tumors, particularly those without calcifications, are more difficult to detect, especially in women with dense breasts. Ultrasonography Breast ultrasonography is used for focused scanning of a questionable finding or for evaluation of a mammographic finding (51). Reliable, portable, computer-enhanced ultrasonography with high-frequency transducers and improved imaging is available to evaluate and treat problems of the breast (52). It is a sensitive, minimally invasive technique that is used frequently to evaluate some breast symptoms, especially in younger women with dense breast tissue, but is dependent on the availability of a skilled ultrasonographer (53). Some lesions can be detected only with ultrasonography (54). It is the preferred modality to distinguish a solid from a cystic mass (51). Breast ultrasonography is not recommended for routine screening, but is being studied as a means to screen women with dense breast tissue (54). Ultrasonography has a higher false-positive rate than mammography (51,53–55). Figure 21.2 Bilateral mammography shows the extent of breast carcinoma, illustrating the importance of bilateral mammography in the workup of a clinically apparent mass. (From Kruper L, Giuliano AE. Breast disease. In: Berek JS, Hacker NF, eds. Berek & Hacker’s Gynecologic Oncology, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2010:617, with permission.)\n\n\n\nFollowing are indications for breast ultrasonography:\n\n\n\nCharacterization: Palpable abnormality Ambiguous mammographic findings Silicone leak Mass in woman younger than 30 years, lactating, or pregnant\n\n\n\nUltrasonography is useful in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions identified by mammography (56). Ultrasonography may be especially useful if the patient feels a mass, but the physician cannot detect an abnormality and the mammogram does not disclose one. It may identify cancers in the dense breast tissue of premenopausal women, but it is usually used to distinguish a benign cyst from a solid tumor. Ultrasonography cannot reliably detect microcalcifications, and it is not as useful as mammography in assessing women with fatty breasts. Handheld or real-time ultrasonography is 95% to 100% accurate in differentiating solid masses from cysts (57). This finding is of limited clinical value because a dominant mass should be evaluated by biopsy, and a cystic mass can be studied by needle aspiration, which is far less expensive than ultrasonography. If a lesion proves to be a simple cyst, no further evaluation is necessary. Rarely ultrasonography may identify a small cancer within a cyst, an intracystic carcinoma. These complex cysts warrant surgical biopsy. Magnetic Resonance Magnetic resonance imaging may be of value in assessing breast lesions of an indeterminate Imaging nature detected by clinical and mammographic examination or occurring in patients who have implants (58). Both MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) are used to identify occult lesions, and MRI is increasing in popularity as a means of imaging the breast (58–60). It tends to be highly sensitive but not specific, leading to biopsies of benign lesions. Image enhancement with gadolinium discriminates between benign and malignant lesions with varying degrees of accuracy. Several roles are proposed for breast MRI. The lack of radiation exposure makes MRI theoretically an ideal method for screening of healthy women, but widespread use is not cost-effective. Focal asymmetry is usually benign but can represent a malignancy. MRI may help identify those patients with focal asymmetric areas who should undergo biopsy. A scar can easily be distinguished from recurrent tumor based on the evaluation and diminution of the scar over time. Some scars do not resolve rapidly and are confused with cancer or, more commonly, with recurrent cancer after breast-conserving surgery and whole breast irradiation. Ideally, such cases are evaluated with MRI, sometimes obviating the need for biopsy. MRI is extremely useful in identifying silicone released by ruptured breast implants in patients with augmented breasts (Fig. 21.3). In patients with implants, MRI with gadolinium may be performed to detect breast cancer even if silicone release is not suspected. There may be a role for MRI in evaluation of specific conditions. It is used for the following indications:\n\n\n\nStage tumor to rule out multicentric disease. Differentiate postoperative scar from recurrence after breast-conserving surgery. Figure 21.3 Mammography shows implant and extracapsular free silicone (arrow). Find a lesion seen in only one view of mammogram. Evaluate positive axillary nodes in the presence of negative mammogram and clinical breast examination results. Rule out silicone implant rupture. Assess focal asymmetry. Detect additional ipsilateral and contralateral cancers. Evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The American Cancer Society recommends annual MRI screening for women who are high risk (greater than 20% lifetime risk) and consideration given to women with moderate risk (15% to 20% lifetime risk) (61). A study from the Netherlands in high-risk women reported 71% sensitivity for MRI compared with 17.9% for clinical breast examination and 40% for mammography (62). The International Cooperative Magnetic Resonance Mammography Study will help identify the advantages and limitations of MRI. At present, MRI should be considered only after conventional imaging is performed; it should not be used as a screening tool or a substitute for mammography or biopsy. Centers that perform MRI should have the ability to perform MRI-guided biopsies of lesions detected with MRI only and that are not visible with mammogram or ultrasound. PET scanning is a diagnostic modality that assesses the metabolic activity of tumors. Radioactive ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an analogue of glucose that is metabolized by tissues of high metabolic activity. Although not specifically approved for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer or for staging the axilla, it can be useful in patients with advanced disease (59,63). This technique is used to identify occult breast lesions with positive axillary lymph nodes (59). Breast Tissue Evaluation: Histology and Cytology\n\n\n\nThe safest course is tissue or cytologic biopsy evaluation of all dominant masses found on physical examination and, in the absence of a mass, evaluation of suspicious lesions shown by breast imaging. Over 1 million women have breast biopsies each year in the United States. Between 70% and 80% of these biopsies yield a benign lesion (64). The diagnosis of a benign breast lesion versus breast cancer is often difficult to determine based on clinical examination and requires evaluation of tissue by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), core needle biopsy (CNB), or excisional biopsy (EB). Both FNAC and CNB are reasonable techniques for the evaluation of a palpable or image-identified lesion. CNB evolved as the diagnostic procedure of choice. More than half of all breast biopsies use a core-needle technique. The sensitivity of CNBs performed using either stereotactic or ultrasound guidance is 97% to 99% (65). CNB is used increasingly to diagnose breast cancer and to determine tumor histology, grade, and marker expression; select neoadjuvant therapy; and predict sentinel lymph node status (66). CNB and fine needle aspiration (FNA) are less invasive and achieve better cosmesis than excisional or even incisional biopsy. The main limitations of FNA are high rate of insufficient sampling and inability to distinguish invasive from noninvasive cancers. CNB is a well-accepted alternative to surgical biopsy and can avoid surgical biopsies in most patients (67). Investigators of the Fifth Radiologic Diagnostic Oncology Group demonstrated that image-guided biopsy of breast lesions provides high diagnostic accuracy. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CNB were 0.91, 1.00, and 0.98, respectively (68). About 30% of lesions suspected to be cancer prove on biopsy to be benign, and about 15% of lesions believed to be benign prove to be malignant (23). Dominant masses or suspicious nonpalpable breast lesions require histopathological examination. Histologic or cytologic diagnosis should be obtained before the decision is made to monitor a breast mass (69). An exception may be a premenopausal woman with a nonsuspicious mass presumed to be fibrocystic disease. An apparently fibrocystic lesion that does not completely resolve within several menstrual cycles should be sampled for biopsy. Any mass in a post-menopausal woman who is not taking estrogen therapy should be presumed to be malignant. Some clinicians will monitor a mass when results of the clinical diagnosis, breast imaging studies, and cytologic studies are all in agreement, such as with fibroadenoma. Many clinicians will not leave a dominant mass in the breast even when FNAC or CNB results are negative, unless the FNA or CNB shows fibroadenoma. Such cases require periodic follow-up. Some surgeons excise lesions when the sampling technique shows only fibrocystic disease. Figures 21.4 and 21.5 present algorithms for management of breast masses in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. Simultaneous evaluation of a breast mass using clinical breast examination, radiography, and needle biopsy can lower the risk of missing cancer to only 1%, effectively reducing the rate of diagnostic failure and increasing the quality of patient care (70). If the presence of breast cancer is strongly suggested by physical examination, the diagnosis can be confirmed by FNAC or CNB, and the patient may be counseled regarding treatment. Treatment should not be determined based on results of physical examination and mammography alone, in the absence of biopsy results. The most reasonable approach to the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is outpatient biopsy (either FNAC, CNB, or EB), followed by definitive surgery at a later date if needed. This two-step approach allows patients to adjust to the diagnosis of cancer, carefully consider alternative forms of therapy, and seek a second opinion. Studies show no adverse effect from the 1to 2-week delay associated with the two-step procedure (71). Because cancer is found in the minority of patients who require biopsy for diagnosis of a breast mass, definitive treatment should not be undertaken without an unequivocal histologic diagnosis of cancer. Fine-Needle Aspiration With FNAC, cells from a breast tumor are aspirated with a small (usually 22-gauge) needle and examined by a pathologist. Precise guidelines for this technique are available (72). It can be performed easily, with no morbidity, and is much less expensive than excisional or open biopsy. It requires the availability of a pathologist skilled in the cytologic diagnosis of breast cancer to interpret the results, and it is subject to sampling problems, particularly when lesions are deep. Cytologic diagnoses must be correlated with clinical and imaging findings to achieve triple-test concordance and to decrease the false-negative rate (73). The triple-test concordance (i.e., concordance between fine-needle aspiration, physical examination, and mammography) is the foundation of breast evaluation. The triple-test results are more powerful than each modality alone (74). The incidence of false-positive diagnoses was 0% to 0.3%, and the rate of false-negative diagnoses was 1.4% to 2.3% in several recent studies (74,75). Core Needle Biopsy A core of tissue can be obtained from palpable lesions using a large cutting needle (76). Image-guided large-core needle biopsy is a reliable diagnostic alternative to surgical excision of suspicious nonpalpable breast lesions (77). As in the case of any needle biopsy, the main drawback is false-negative findings caused by improper positioning of the needle. False-negative findings may be reduced if core biopsy is performed with ultrasonographic guidance. The interpretation of results from CNB is classified by categories B1 to B5 (78):\n\n\n\nB1: Normal tissue\n\n\n\nB2: Benign lesions: fibroadenomas, fibrocystic change, sclerosing adenosis, duct ectasia, fat necrosis, abscess\n\n\n\nB3: Uncertain malignant potential: atypical epithelial hyperplasia, lobular neoplasia, phyllodes tumor, papillary lesions, radial scar, complex sclerosing lesions\n\n\n\nB4: Suspicious\n\n\n\nB5: Malignant\n\n\n\nOpen Excisional Biopsy Open biopsy with local anesthesia as a separate procedure before deciding on definitive treatment is the most reliable means of diagnosis. Its utility is reserved for when the results of needle biopsy are nondiagnostic or equivocal. Figure 21.4 Algorithm for management of breast masses in premenopausal women.

Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2010:629, with permission.)\n\n\n\nHistologic Analysis Histologic evaluation with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining confirms benign or malignant disease. Images of benign and malignant breast lesions can be viewed through the Internet Pathology Laboratory for Medical Education (79). Assessment of prognostic factors, tumor grade; estrogen, progesterone, her-2/neu receptor status; and proliferative indices is performed on paraffin-fixed tissue by immunohistochemistry (78). Her-2/neu assessment in breast cancer by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is appropriate for patients with tumors that score 3+. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is recommended for 2+ IHC to more accurately assess her-2/neu amplification and provide better prognostic information (80). Ductal Lavage Cytology Ductal lavage using a microcatheter is a modality that was investigated in high-risk women (81). Patients undergo gentle nipple suction to elicit nipple ﬂuid. A duct that yields ﬂuid is cannulated with a microcatheter, and 10 to 20 mL of saline are introduced in 2-to 4-mL increments. The cytologic assessment of a sample obtained by ductal lavage is more sensitive than that of nipple aspiration. Ductal lavage performed to identify abnormal cells is not an effective tool in detecting breast cancer and is rarely performed (81). Benign breast disorders account for most breast problems. These conditions are frequently considered in the context of excluding breast cancer and often are unrecognized for their own associated morbidity (82). To provide appropriate management, it is important to consider benign breast disorders from four aspects: (i) clinical picture, (ii) medical significance, (iii) treatment intervention, and (iv) pathologic etiology (83). A framework for understanding benign breast problems is called Aberrations of Normal Development and Involution (ANDI) (2,82,83). It includes symptoms, histology, endocrine state, and pathogenesis in a progression from a normal to a disease state. Most benign breast conditions arise from normal changes in breast development, hormone cycling, and reproductive evolution (82). Three life cycles reﬂect different reproductive phases in a woman’s life and are associated with unique breast manifestations. 1. During the early reproductive period (15–25 years), lobule and stromal formation occurs. The ANDI conditions associated with this period are fibroadenoma (mass) and juvenile hypertrophy (excessive breast development). In this first stage, the progression from ANDI to a disease state results in the formation of giant fibroadenomas and multiple fibroadenomas. 2. During the mature reproductive period (25 to 40 years), cyclic hormonal changes affect glandular tissue and stroma. In this second period, the ANDI is an exaggeration of these cyclic effects, such as cyclic mastalgia and generalized nodularity. 3. The third phase is involution of lobules and ducts or turnover of epithelia, which occurs during ages 35 to 55 years. The ANDI associated with lobular involution are macrocysts (lumps) and sclerosing lesions (mammographic abnormalities). Those associated with ductal involution are duct dilation (nipple discharge) and periductal fibrosis (nipple retraction), and those with epithelial turnover are mild hyperplasia (pathologic description). Disease conditions with increased epithelial turnover are epithelial hyperplasias with atypia. Breasts are under endocrine control and show a wide range of appearances during reproductive life. ANDI classification allows the clinician to understand the pathogenesis of these conditions and to understand that these disorders are aberrations of a normal process that does not usually require any specific treatment (82). Fibrocystic Change Fibrocystic change, the most common lesion of the breast, is an imprecise term that covers a spectrum of clinical signs, symptoms, and histologic changes (76). The term refers to a histologic picture of fibrosis, cyst formation, and epithelial hyperplasia (83). Cysts arise from the breast lobules and are an aberration of normal breast involution (82). Macroscopic cysts occur in approximately 7% of women, and microscopic, nonpalpable cysts occur in about 40% of women (84). It is common in women 35 to 55 years of age, but rare in postmenopausal women not taking hormone therapy. The presence of estrogen seems necessary for the clinical symptoms to occur. This finding is supported by the observation that it is present bilaterally, increased in the perimenopausal age group, and responsive to endocrine therapy (85). In essence, a diagnosis of fibrocystic change can lead to significant patient anxiety but is of little clinical significance as long as malignancy is excluded (86). These lesions are associated with benign changes in the breast epithelium. Cyst Fluid Analysis Investigators examined the electrolyte and protein content of cyst ﬂuid, but this is of little significance in the clinical management of fibrocystic disease. The potassium-to-sodium ratio is a marker that may be used to distinguish cyst subtypes (87). Cysts are either lined by apocrine epithelium with a high potassium-to-sodium ratio and a higher hormone or steroid concentration (type I); or by ﬂattened lobule epithelium with a low potassium-to-sodium ratio and a higher concentration of albumin, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA125, and steroid hormone–binding globulin (type II) (87). Apocrine cysts produce and secrete large amounts of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (88). The role of this serine protease in proliferative breast disease is not fully understood. Fibrocystic changes may produce an asymptomatic mass that is smooth, mobile, and potentially compressible. Fibrocystic change is more often accompanied by pain or tenderness and sometimes nipple discharge. In many cases, discomfort coincides with the premenstrual phase of the cycle, when the cysts tend to enlarge. Fluctuations in size and rapid appearance or disappearance of a breast mass are common. Multiple or bilateral masses appear frequently, and many patients have a history of a transient mass in the breast or cyclic breast pain. Cyclic breast pain is the most commonly associated symptom of fibrocystic changes. Differential Diagnosis Pain, ﬂuctuation in size, multiplicity of lesions, and bilaterality are the features most helpful to differentiate fibrocystic disease from carcinoma. If a dominant mass is present, the diagnosis of cancer should be suspected until it is disproved by complete aspiration of a cyst, or histopathologic analysis if a mass is present after aspiration, or by breast imaging. Microscopic findings associated with fibrocystic disease include cysts (gross and microscopic), papillomatosis, adenosis, fibrosis, and ductal epithelial hyperplasia (89). Diagnostic Tests Patients with cystic disease may have a discrete fibrocystic mass that is frequently indistinguishable from carcinoma, based on clinical findings. Mammography may be helpful, but there are no mammographic signs diagnostic of fibrocystic change. Ultrasonography is useful in differentiating a cystic from a solid mass. Characteristic findings on ultrasonography that confirm a simple cyst include the following:\n\n\n\nMass with thin walls\n\n\n\nAbsence of internal echoes\n\n\n\nIf these imaging criteria are not met, a tissue diagnosis of the mass usually requires a FNA, FNAC, or EB. The finding of a simple cyst by ultrasonography rules out carcinoma. Any lesion that is suspicious by mammography or ultrasonography should be biopsied. When the diagnosis of fibrocystic change is established by ultrasonography or is practically certain because the history is classic, aspiration of a discrete mass, suggestive of a cyst, is indicated if the patient is symptomatic, the cyst obscures visualization of breast tissue on mammography and prevents adequate imaging, or if the ultrasonographic criteria are not met. In one study of a screened population, 1% of individuals developed a new cyst that resolved in more than 50% of cases (90). Aspiration may be performed with ultrasonographic guidance, but image guidance is usually not necessary if the cyst is palpable (91). FNA of a cyst is a minimally invasive procedure performed with a 21-or 22-gauge needle without local anesthesia and is not associated with significant risks or complications. There is minimal pain and little risk for infection or bleeding. Benign cyst ﬂuid is straw colored to dark green to brownish and does not need to be submitted for cytologic evaluation (6). Injection of air into the cyst cavity is reported to reduce the likelihood of cyst recurrence but generally is not performed. The patient should be reexamined at a short interval thereafter for cyst recurrence. Cysts will reoccur in 30% of patients, cause anxiety, and require repeated evaluations (84). Tissue biopsy should be performed in the presence of the following findings:\n\n\n\nNo cyst ﬂuid is obtained. The ﬂuid is bloody. The ﬂuid is thick. The cyst is complex. There is an intracystic mass. A mass persists after aspiration. A persistent mass is noted at any time during follow-up. If a needle biopsy is performed and results are negative for malignancy, a suspicious mass that does not resolve over several months should be excised. Surgery should be conservative, because the primary objective is to exclude cancer. Simple mastectomy or extensive removal of breast tissue is not indicated for fibrocystic disease. Most patients do not require treatment for fibrocystic changes, just reassurance that fibrocystic change is a transient phenomenon of aging that is associated with hormonal effects on the breast glandular tissue that eventually subsides. Fibrocystic change is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer unless there is histologic evidence of epithelial proliferative changes, with or without atypia (92–97). The common coincidence of fibrocystic disease and malignancy in the same breast reﬂects the fact that both processes are common events. Approximately 80% of biopsies show fibrocystic changes. In an evaluation of the relationship between fibrocystic change and breast cancer in 10,366 women who underwent biopsy between 1950 and 1968 and were followed for a median of 17 years, approximately 70% of the biopsies showed nonproliferative breast disease, whereas 30% showed proliferative breast disease (95). Cytologic atypia were present in 3.6% of cases. Women with nonproliferative disease had no increased risk of breast cancer, whereas women with proliferative breast disease and no atypical hyperplasia had a twofold higher risk of breast cancer. Patients whose biopsy results showed atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia had an approximately fivefold higher risk than women with nonproliferative disease to develop invasive breast cancer in either breast. Patients with carcinoma in situ have an eight-to tenfold risk of developing breast cancer. This risk is bilateral for lobular lesions and ipsilateral for ductal lesions. A family history of breast cancer added little risk for women with nonproliferative disease, but family history plus atypia increased breast cancer risk 11-fold. The presence of cysts alone did not increase the risk of breast cancer, but cysts combined with a family history of breast cancer increased the risk about threefold (76,92–97). Women with these risk factors (family history of breast cancer and proliferative breast disease) should be followed carefully with physical examination and mammography. For such women, age-specific probability of developing invasive breast carcinoma in the next 10 years is 1 in 2,000 (age 20), 1 in 256 (age 30), 1 in 67 (age 40), 1 in 39 (age 50), and 1 in 29 (age 60) (93). The relative risk for developing breast cancer depends on the type of proliferative lesion diagnosed. Management of Fibrocystic Change\n\n\n\nFibrocystic change is a normal evolutionary change in breast development and involution and does not require a specific treatment other than a good clinical breast examination and age-appropriate mammographic screening or imaging studies directed to signs and symptoms. A number of nutritional and dietary supplements were investigated to relieve symptoms. The role of caffeine consumption in the aggravation of fibrocystic change is controversial (98– 101). Results of some studies suggest that eliminating caffeine from the diet is associated with improvement of symptoms (100,101). Many patients are aware of these studies and report relief of symptoms after discontinuing intake of coffee, tea, and chocolate. Similarly, many women find vitamin E (150 to 600 IU daily) or B6 (200 to 800 mg per day) helpful (102,103). Observations about these effects are difficult to confirm and are anecdotal (104–106). A recent review of nutritional interventions for fibrocystic breast conditions that evaluated evening primrose oil, vitamin E, or pyridoxine suggested that there are insufficient data to draw clear conclusions about their effectiveness (107). Exacerbations of pain, tenderness, and cyst formation may occur at any time until menopause, when symptoms usually subside unless patients are taking estrogen. A patient with fibrocystic changes should be advised to examine her own breasts each month just after menstruation and to inform her physician if a mass appears. Mastalgia Mastalgia is a recognized organic condition that is studied less thoroughly than other breast problems (108,109). Inﬂammatory cytokines were implicated in the etiology of breast pain. A study evaluating expression of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in painful and non-painful breast tissue showed lower levels of these cytokines in painful breast tissue during the luteal phase; however, these levels did not reach statistical significance (110). Elevated estrogen, low progesterone, or an imbalance in the ratio of estrogen and progesterone were suggested as a possible cause for the symptoms (111). Natural History of Mastalgia\n\n\n\nApproximately 70% to 80% of women experience severe breast pain at some time in their lives (112,113). Mastalgia accounts for 30% to 47% of breast clinical evaluations (111,114). In 15% of the patients, the mastalgia is so severe that it alters lifestyle and requires repeated investigations and treatment (112). Mastalgia interferes with sexual (48%), physical (37%), social (12%), and work or school activities (8%) (115). Types of Mastalgia Breast pain is a distressing constellation of symptoms that is classified as cyclic, noncyclic, or extramammary (116). Cyclic mastalgia is related to exaggerated premenstrual symptoms beginning in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, associated with breast engorgement, pain, ache, heaviness, and tenderness that is bilateral and can last for more than 7 days in 11% of women (116–118). Cyclical mastalgia is more prevalent in women in their third and fourth decades of life and accounts for two-thirds of all breast pain symptoms (119). Noncyclic mastalgia is independent of menstrual cycles and is described as achy, burning soreness. It may be intermittent or constant, is usually unilateral, occurs in the fourth and fifth decades, and is more difficult to treat than cyclic mastalgia (116). Extramammary pain is perceived to be located in the breast but is related to an extramammary site. Chest wall muscular pain, costal cartilage symptoms, herpes zoster, radiculopathies, and rib fractures are among some of the more common causes of extramammary pain. Costochondritis (Tietze syndrome) is a manifestation of chest wall pain that is frequently interpreted as breast pain. Management of Mastalgia Breast pain is an unlikely symptom of malignancy, and when malignancy is excluded by a clinical breast examination and age-appropriate breast imaging for focal breast pain, the most important treatment is reassurance. Treatments include medications, such as anesthetics, diuretics, bromocriptine, and tamoxifen; vitamins and supplements, such as evening primrose oil; mechanical support with a well-fitting bra; local excision; and decreased fat intake and reduction in methylxanthines from caffeine, tea, and chocolate (108,116). Discontinuation of hormone therapy may be effective in some women. Maintenance of a pain score diary is important to understand the relationship of pain to factors such as the menstrual cycle, activities of daily living, and stress. External support may be effective for breast pain associated with generalized fibrocystic changes and is best treated by avoiding trauma and by wearing (night and day) a brassiere that gives good support and protection (120). One study evaluated resolution of symptoms in 200 women randomized either to a regimen of danazol (200 mg per day) or to mechanical support with a sports brassiere worn for regular activities for 12 weeks. The group using mechanical support had 85% relief of symptoms compared with 58% improvement in the danazol group. Symptoms recurred after discontinuance of treatment with danazol (113). The danazol group experienced drug-related side effects in 42%, which led to discontinuance of the medication in 15%. The breast has minimal structural support and is at significant risk for motion-related displacement resulting in mastalgia. The use of external support to minimize breast motion appears to be effective in reducing breast pain. The application of heat packs or cold packs and light breast massage may reduce symptoms in some individuals (116). Hormone-modulating drugs, including danazol, bromocriptine, tamoxifen, and Depo-Provera, are recognized drug treatments for mastalgia, although tamoxifen is not approved for this use in the United States (116,121–124). These drugs are associated with significant side effects that limit their general use (116). Withdrawal of birth control pills or hormone therapy may be all that is required to alleviate symptoms (116). Danazol is a synthetic androgen that suppresses release of pituitary gonadotropin, prevents luteinizing hormone surge, and inhibits ovarian steroid formation. It is the only medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for mastalgia (116). The androgenic effects—acne, edema, change in voice, weight gain, headaches, depression, and hirsutism— often are intolerable, and many patients stop taking danazol even when symptoms are improved (122). It can be initiated at doses of 100 to 200 mg twice daily orally for patients with severe pain and then tapered to a lower dose of 100 mg per day (122). A survey of surgeons in Great Britain revealed that 75% prescribed danazol as first-line therapy (108). A study conducted to evaluate the response to administration of danazol revealed a 79% amelioration of symptoms (125). This approach reduced the premenstrual mastalgia and resulted in virtually no side effects. The use of oral progesterone agents reduces cyclical breast pain (111). Further studies may be warranted to see whether medroxyprogesterone acetate suppresses cyclic mastalgia in reproductive-age women. Breast pain is increased in some individuals who have elevated prolactin (PRL) levels induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (116). Bromocriptine is a dopamine antagonist that inhibits the release of PRL. Bromocriptine (2.5 mg twice daily) given for 3 to 6 months is effective in reducing mastalgia in women who have TRH-induced elevation of PRL (123). Patients who have normal TRH levels, are resistant to bromocriptine, or do not tolerate the side effects of nausea, vomiting, and headache respond favorably to progesterone and systemic nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Prolactin induces active transport of iodine in breast tissue (126,127). Iodine deficiency in rats causes hyperplasia and atypia (128). Iodine replacement is associated with improvement in subjective pain (129). A randomized, double-blind study with supraphysiologic levels of iodine in women with documented cyclic mastalgia demonstrated dose-dependent reduction in physician-assessed and self-reported pain at 3 and 6 months of treatment (130). Goserelin is a potent synthetic analogue of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) that causes reversible reduction in serum estrogen level and decrease in breast pain (131). Side effects of goserelin include vaginal dryness, hot ﬂushes, decreased libido, oily skin and hair, and decreased breast size. A recent clinical trial randomized 147 women into goserelin versus placebo groups. The study had a 49% drop-out rate. The mean breast pain score decreased by 67% in the goserelin arm and 35% in the placebo arm. The authors concluded that goserelin is an effective treatment for mastalgia with significant side effects and should be kept as second-line therapy. Hormonal blockade of the estrogen receptor is another approach to minimizing the effects of circulating estrogen on breast pain. Treatment with the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen demonstrated reduction in breast pain at 10 and 20 mg per day, with equivalent effects compared with danazol and bromocriptine in most studies (124,132–134). Topical nonsteroidal therapy is another option for women with mastalgia (135). Gel forms of NSAIDs often are used for relief of pain. Patients were stratified by cyclic versus noncyclic pain and then randomized to treatment with NSAIDs versus placebo. There was a significant reduction in cyclic and noncyclic pain in all groups, but the magnitude of change was greater in the treatment arms and similar for cyclic and noncyclic pain. Use of NSAIDs appears to be a less toxic treatment and may be considered as an option for both cyclic and noncyclic breast pain. Nonhormonal therapies such as dietary restrictions, vitamins and supplements, and restriction of methylxantines were investigated as possible treatments for mastalgia because they are less likely to be associated with adverse drug-related side effects (116). Because mastalgia is one of the symptoms associated with fibrocystic disease, the treatments described for fibrocystic disease are relevant to mastalgia. A low-fat diet was effective in one randomized trial (136). Ninety percent of patients taking in 15% dietary fat experienced resolution of pain symptoms after 6 months compared with only 22% of those on a diet containing 36% fat (p = .0023). Evening primrose oil containing essential fatty acids (γ -linolenic acid [GLA]) was studied because of its affect on prostaglandin synthesis (137). It was used as first-line therapy, reserving danazol and bromocriptine for treatment of more severe symptoms (112). In a small prospective mastalgia trial, women were given eight capsules of evening primrose oil daily for 4 months (320 mg GLA) (138). Those who responded had a lower level of essential fatty acids at the time of initiation when compared with poor responders, suggesting that evening primrose oil increases essential fatty acids and that this increase may be associated with the improvement in symptoms in the responders. Two other trials failed to demonstrate efficacy of evening primrose oil capsules over placebo (139,140). In a Dutch trial, 124 women with cyclic or noncyclic pain lasting on average 7 or more days (minimum 5 days) were randomized to receive the following regimens: (i) fish oil and control oil, (ii) evening primrose oil and control oil, (iii) fish and evening primrose oil, or (iv) both control oils for 6 months (139). There was a statistically significant reduction in the number of days per month with pain but not in the pain score in the entire study population. There was a greater reduction in cyclic than noncyclic pain symptoms, and this finding was true for both the test oils and for the control oils. The authors concluded that neither fish oil nor evening primrose oil had a better effect than the less expensive wheat germ and corn oils. A second large double-blind randomized prospective trial was conducted in 555 women with cyclic mastalgia of moderate to severe degree present for at least 7 days of a menstrual cycle (140). The four groups were (i) GLA and placebo antioxidants, (ii) placebo fatty acids and antioxidants, (iii) GLA and placebo antioxidants, and (iv) placebo fatty acids and placebo antioxidants. The treatments were given in a blinded fashion for 4 months. All groups had a similar 35% reduction in symptoms. This treatment was followed by open treatment with GLA in all groups and blinded treatment with antioxidants. There was continued improvement of symptoms in all groups with a reduction in mastalgia by 50% over the next 12 months. This is the largest and best-controlled study to date evaluating GLA for relief of mastalgia, and GLA was not found to be superior to placebo. The results of this study were not consistent with those from previous smaller studies. The authors cannot exclude a significant psychologic impact that may confound the effect of GLA. GLA use was found to be safe, without any significant side effects, and was prescribed as therapy for mastalgia because of its lack of side effects. The randomized trials, however, bring into serious question the efficacy of these options. Fibroadenoma Fibroadenomas are the most common benign tumors of the breast. In one series, they accounted for 50% of all breast biopsies (141). They usually occur in young women (age 20 to 35 years) and may occur in teenagers (142). In women younger than 25 years, fibroadenomas are more common than cysts. They rarely occur after menopause, although occasionally they are found, often calcified, in postmenopausal women. For this reason, it is postulated that fibroadenomas are responsive to estrogen stimulation. A study reports the de novo occurrence of fibroadenoma in 51 women older than age 35 years who had no evidence of a palpable or mammographic visualized lesion in well-documented prior visits (143). Fibroadenomas may appear as single masses or as multiple lesions. Clinically, a young woman usually notices a mass while showering or dressing. Most masses are 2 to 3 cm in diameter when detected, but they can become extremely large (i.e., the giant fibroadenoma). On physical examination, they are firm, smooth, and rubbery. They do not elicit an inﬂammatory reaction, are freely mobile, and cause no dimpling of the skin or nipple retraction. They are often bilobed, and a groove can be palpated on examination. On mammographic and ultrasonographic imaging, the typical features are of a well-defined, smooth, solid mass with clearly defined margins and dimensions that are longer than wide and craniocaudad dimensions that are less than the length. Fibroadenoma is not associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (144). The natural history of fibroadenoma can be regression, growth, or no change in size. Most fibroadenomas are static or cease growth at approximately 2 to 3 cm, about 15% of tumors regress spontaneously, and only 5% to 10% progress (145). Because transformation of a fibroadenoma into cancer is rare and regression is frequent, current management recommendations are conservative unless there is evidence of growth (141). A suspected fibroadenoma should be confirmed by FNAC or CNB and observed for increase in size or excised based on patient preference. Rarely will the fibroadenoma increase to more than 2 to 3 cm in size. Large or growing fibroadenomas must be excised. Complete excision of a fibroadenoma with local anesthesia can be performed to treat the lesion and confirm the absence of malignancy. Less invasive local treatment of a fibroadenoma is advocated by some and can be performed with either ultrasonographically guided percutaneous vacuum-assisted biopsy devices or percutaneous cryoablation (146,147). A young woman with a clinical fibroadenoma can undergo needle cytology and observation of the mass (148). Acceptance of observation varies, and many women choose to have the fibroadenoma excised (149). On gross examination of an excised mass, the fibroadenoma appears encapsulated and sharply delineated from the surrounding breast parenchyma. Microscopically, there is proliferation of both the epithelial and stromal component. In longstanding lesions and in postmenopausal patients, calcifications may be observed within the stroma. Multiple Fibroadenomas Multiple fibroadenomas occur in some women and were reported to occur more frequently in premenopausal women undergoing immunosuppression for transplant (150–152). Excision of all lesions through separate incisions could leave significant scarring and deformity. Excision of these mobile lesions through a single periareolar incision was suggested, but this approach can lead to significant ductal disruption (153). Another approach is through an incision in the inframammary crease. Alternatively, these lesions can be treated with observation based on triple-test concordance of results of a classic clinical examination with histologic corroboration with FNAC and ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria consistent with a fibroadenoma (151). Phyllodes Tumor Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial tumors that display a spectrum of clinical and pathologic behaviors that are benign, borderline, and malignant (154,155). The distribution of phyllodes tumors demonstrates that most tumors are benign (70%) compared with malignant (23%) and borderline lesions (7%) (156). This distribution is similar to a larger, older study that reported an incidence of 64% benign, 21% malignant, and 14% borderline phyllodes tumors (157). The incidence in some studies should be viewed with caution because of variation in histologic interpretation (156). Phyllodes tumors may occur at any age but tend to be more common in women who are in their late 30s, 40s, and 50s (156,158–162). These lesions are rarely bilateral and usually appear as isolated masses that are difficult to distinguish clinically from a fibroadenoma. Patients often relate a long history of a previously stable nodule that suddenly increases in size. Reported sizes range from 1.0 to 50 cm (154,163,164). Size is not a dependable diagnostic criterion, although phyllodes tumors tend to be larger than fibroadenomas, probably because of their rapid growth. There are no good clinical criteria by which to distinguish a phyllodes tumor from a fibroadenoma. Whereas observation of a fibroadenoma is acceptable, excision of a phyllodes tumor is necessary for local control and for determination of benign or malignant features. To avoid unnecessary excision of benign fibroadenomas that are indistinguishable from phyllodes tumors on clinical examination, imaging criteria were sought to aid in identifying patients who require EB for complete histopathologic evaluation and local control. Mammography may show a halo around a phyllodes tumor mass but cannot reliably distinguish a fibroadenoma from a phyllodes tumor (165–167). Ultrasonography evaluation has limitations even when color and pulse Doppler ultrasonography are used in conjunction with it (163). Microscopic evaluation of a lesion is important to determine the diagnosis. The histologic distinction between fibroadenoma, benign, borderline, and malignant phyllodes tumor can be very difficult on minimal tissue sampling with FNAC or CNB (168,169). It may be easier to distinguish benign phyllodes from malignant phyllodes tumors than benign phyllodes tumors from fibroadenomas (170). Histologic features that stratify lesions include number of mitoses per high power field, stromal cellularity, pushing or infiltrating tumor margin, cellular atypia, tumor necrosis, and stromal overgrowth (171). If a lesion cannot be clearly characterized as a fibroadenoma, excision may be necessary. Factors that are considered in recommending excision include older age, new mass in a well-screened individual, rapid growth, size greater than 2.5 to 3 cm, suspicious FNAC or CB, and mammographic or ultrasonographic features that demonstrate lobulation and intramural cysts. If observation is elected, repeat clinical examination and imaging in a short interval is essential to evaluate change in size. Treatment of biopsy-proven phyllodes tumor is wide local excision, attempting to obtain a 1-to 2-cm margin (156–161). Massive tumors, or large tumors in relatively small breasts, may require mastectomy; otherwise, mastectomy should be avoided, and axillary lymph node dissection is not indicated. Often, however, a patient will undergo excisional biopsy of a mass believed to be fibroadenoma, and final histologic examination reveals a phyllodes tumor. Reexcision with normal breast margins is recommended for borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors (159). An expectant approach is an option for unanticipated diagnosis of benign phyllodes tumors (157). The prognosis of benign and malignant phyllodes tumors is variable (154,155,157,162,172). Tumors judged to be benign phyllodes tumors can recur locally in up to 10% of patients (159–161). Recurrence is associated with margin involvement, whereas mortality correlates with size and grade (173). In a series reviewing only high-grade malignant phyllodes tumors, size and excision margins were associated with local recurrence and metastatic spread, and mastectomy may be required to achieve complete surgical excision (174). Malignant phyllodes tumors tend to recur locally and occasionally may metastasize to the lung, although brain, pelvic, and bone metastases also may occur (160–162). The stromal component of the tumor is malignant and metastasizes, behaving like a sarcoma. Axillary involvement is extremely unusual. Often, the appearance of metastasis is the first sign that a phyllodes tumor is malignant. Chemotherapy for metastatic phyllodes tumors should be based on regimens for sarcoma, not adenocarcinoma (159). Radiation therapy generally is not used in the treatment of phyllodes tumors. In the presence of a bulky tumor, positive margins, recurrence, or malignant histology, radiation therapy may be of some benefit (175). Nipple Discharge Nipple discharge is a presenting breast symptom in 4.5% of patients seeking evaluation of a breast symptom, with 48% spontaneous and 52% provoked (176). Nipple discharge that does not occur spontaneously has no pathologic significance. Provoked or self-induced nipple discharge should be managed by reassurance and instruction to discontinue manipulation. Spontaneous nipple discharge is more likely to be associated with an underlying pathologic problem than provoked discharge. Although it is a distressing finding, spontaneous nipple discharge is infrequently found to be associated with carcinoma, ranging from 4% to 10% (176–178). Nipple discharge can be caused by neoplastic or nonneoplastic processes (179). Nonneoplastic processes include galactorrhea, physiologic changes resulting from mechanical manipulation, parous condition, periductal mastitis, subareolar abscess, fibrocystic change, and mammary duct ectasia. Neoplastic causes of nipple discharge in nonlactating women are solitary intraductal papilloma, carcinoma, papillomatosis, squamous metaplasia, and adenosis (176,179,180). Extramammary causes are related to hormones and drugs (179). Following are the important characteristics of the discharge and other factors to be evaluated by history and physical examination (180): 1. Nature of discharge (serous, bloody, or milky) 2. Association with a mass 3. 4.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['If the presence of breast cancer is strongly suggested by physical examination, the diagnosis can be confirmed by FNAC or CNB, and the patient may be counseled regarding treatment. Treatment should not be determined based on results of physical examination and mammography alone, in the absence of biopsy results. The most reasonable approach to the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is outpatient biopsy (either FNAC, CNB, or EB), followed by definitive surgery at a later date if needed. This two-step approach allows patients to adjust to the diagnosis of cancer, carefully consider alternative forms of therapy, and seek a second opinion. Studies show no adverse effect from the 1to 2-week delay associated with the two-step procedure (71). Because cancer is found in the minority of patients who require biopsy for diagnosis of a breast mass, definitive treatment should not be undertaken without an unequivocal histologic diagnosis of cancer.', 'the physician and patient evaluating breast diseases.

Bluish-red passive hyperemia of the cervix is characteristic, but not of itself diagnostic, of pregnancy. Dilated, occluded cervical glands bulging beneath the ectocervical mucosa-nabothian cysts-may be prominent. he cervix is not normally dilated except at the external os. To identiy cytological abnormalities, a Pap test is performed according to current guidelines noted in Chapter 63 (p. 1193). Specimens for identiication of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are also obtained when indicated. Bimanual examination is completed by palpation, with special attention given to the consistency, length, and dilatation of the cervix; to uterine and adnexal size; to the bony pelvic architecture; and to any vaginal or perineal anomalies. Later in pregnancy, fetal presentation often can also be determined. Lesions of the cevix, vagina, or vulva are further evaluated as needed by colposcopy, biopsy, culture, or dark-field examination. The perianal region is visualized, and digital rectal examination performed as required for complaints of rectal pain, bleeding, or mass. Precise knowledge of gestational age is one of the most important aspects of prenatal care because several pregnancy complications may develop for which optimal treatment will depend on fetal age. As discussed earlier and in Chapter 7 (p. 124), irst-trimester sonographic assessment is best correlated with menstrual history. That said, gestational age can also be estimated with considerable precision by carefully performed clinical uterine size examination that is coupled with knowledge of the last menses. Uterine size similar to a small orange roughly correlates with a 6-week gestation; a large orange, with an 8-week pregnancy; and a grapefruit, with one at 12 weeks (Margulies, 2001). Recommended routine tests at the first prenatal encounter are listed in Table 9-1. Initial blood tests include a complete blood count, a determination of blood type with h status, and an antibody screen. The Institute of Medicine recommends universal human immunodeiciency virus (HIV) testing, with patient notiication and right of refusal, as a routine part of prenatal care. The CDC (Branson, 2006) as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 16f, 2017) continue to support this practice. If a woman declines testing, this is recorded in the prenatal record. All pregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B virus infection, syphilis, and immunity to rubella at the initial visit. Based on their prospective investigation of 1000 women, Murray and coworkers (2002) concluded that in the absence of hypertension, routine urinalysis beyond the irst prenatal visit was not necessary.

","['362). A proportion of patients with hepatitis C have isolated anti-HBc in their blood, a reflection of a common risk in certain populations of exposure to multiple bloodborne hepatitis agents. The anti-HBc in such cases is almost invariably of the IgG class and usually represents HBV infection in the remote past (HBV DNA undetectable); it rarely represents current HBV infection with low-level virus carriage. The presence of HDV infection can be identified by demonstrating intrahepatic HDV antigen or, more practically, an anti-HDV seroconversion (a rise in titer of anti-HDV or de novo appearance of anti-HDV). Circulating HDV antigen, also diagnostic of acute infection, is detectable only briefly, if at all. Because anti-HDV is often undetectable once HBsAg disappears, retrospective serodiagnosis of acute self-limited, simultaneous HBV and HDV infection is difficult. Early diagnosis of acute infection may be hampered by a delay of up to 30–40 days in the appearance of anti-HDV. When a patient presents with acute hepatitis and has HBsAg and anti-HDV in serum, determination of the class of anti-HBc is helpful in establishing the relationship between infection with HBV and HDV. Although IgM anti-HBc does not distinguish absolutely between acute and chronic HBV infection, its presence is a reliable indicator of recent infection and its absence a reliable indicator of infection in the remote past. In simultaneous acute HBV and HDV infections, IgM anti-HBc will be detectable, whereas in acute HDV infection superimposed on chronic HBV infection, anti-HBc will be of the IgG class. Tests for the presence of HDV RNA are useful for determining the presence of ongoing HDV replication and relative infectivity. The serologic/virologic course of events during acute hepatitis E is entirely analogous to that of acute hepatitis A, with brief fecal shedding of virus and viremia and an early IgM anti-HEV response that predominates during approximately the first 3 months but is eclipsed thereafter by long-lasting IgG anti-HEV. Diagnostic tests of varying reliability for hepatitis E are commercially available but used routinely primarily outside the United States; in the United States, diagnostic serologic/virologic assays can be performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or other specialized reference laboratories. Liver biopsy is rarely necessary or indicated in acute viral hepatitis, except when the diagnosis is questionable or when clinical evidence suggests a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis. A diagnostic algorithm can be applied in the evaluation of cases of acute viral hepatitis. A patient with acute hepatitis should undergo four serologic tests, HBsAg, IgM anti-HAV, IgM anti-HBc, and anti-HCV (Table 360-6). The presence of HBsAg, with or without IgM anti-HBc, represents HBV infection. If IgM anti-HBc is present, the HBV infection is considered acute; if IgM anti-HBc is absent, the HBV infection is considered chronic. A diagnosis of acute hepatitis B can be made in\n\n\n\nSerologic Tests of Patient’s Serum\n\n\n\nNote: See text for abbreviations. the absence of HBsAg when IgM anti-HBc is detectable. A diagnosis of acute hepatitis A is based on the presence of IgM anti-HAV. If IgM anti-HAV coexists with HBsAg, a diagnosis of simultaneous HAV and HBV infections can be made; if IgM anti-HBc (with or without HBsAg) is detectable, the patient has simultaneous acute hepatitis A and B, and if IgM anti-HBc is undetectable, the patient has acute hepatitis A superimposed on chronic HBV infection. The presence of anti-HCV supports a diagnosis of acute hepatitis C. Occasionally, testing for HCV RNA or repeat anti-HCV testing later during the illness is necessary to establish the diagnosis. Absence of all serologic markers is consistent with a diagnosis of “non-A, non-B, non-C” hepatitis, if the epidemiologic setting is appropriate. In patients with chronic hepatitis, initial testing should consist of HBsAg and anti-HCV. Anti-HCV supports and HCV RNA testing establishes the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C. If a serologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is made, testing for HBeAg and anti-HBe is indicated to evaluate relative infectivity. Testing for HBV DNA in such patients provides a more quantitative and sensitive measure of the level of virus replication and, therefore, is very helpful during antiviral therapy (Chap. 362). In patients with chronic hepatitis B and normal aminotransferase activity in the absence of HBeAg, serial testing over time is often required to distinguish between inactive carriage and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B with fluctuating virologic and necroinflammatory activity. In persons with hepatitis B, testing for anti-HDV is useful in those with severe and fulminant disease, with severe chronic disease, with chronic hepatitis B and acute hepatitis-like exacerbations, with frequent percutaneous exposures, and from areas where HDV infection is endemic. Virtually all previously healthy patients with hepatitis A recover completely with no clinical sequelae. Similarly, in acute hepatitis B, 95–99% of previously healthy adults have a favorable course and recover completely. Certain clinical and laboratory features, however, suggest a more complicated and protracted course. Patients of advanced age and with serious underlying medical disorders may have a prolonged course and are more likely to experience severe hepatitis. Initial presenting features such as ascites, peripheral edema, and symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy suggest a poorer prognosis. In addition, a prolonged PT, low serum albumin level, hypoglycemia, and very high serum bilirubin values suggest severe hepatocellular disease. Patients with these clinical and laboratory features deserve prompt hospital admission. The case fatality rate in hepatitis A and B is very low (~0.1%) but is increased by advanced age and underlying debilitating disorders. Among patients ill enough to be hospitalized for acute hepatitis B, the fatality rate is 1%. Hepatitis C is less severe during the acute phase than hepatitis B and is more likely to be anicteric; fatalities are rare, but the precise case fatality rate is not known. In outbreaks of waterborne hepatitis E in India and Asia, the case fatality rate is 1–2% and up to 10–20% in pregnant women. Contributing to fulminant hepatitis E in endemic countries are instances of acute hepatitis E superimposed on underlying chronic liver disease (“acute-on-chronic” liver disease). Patients with simultaneous acute hepatitis B and hepatitis D do not necessarily experience a higher mortality rate than do patients with acute hepatitis B alone; however, in several outbreaks of acute simultaneous HBV and HDV infection among injection drug users, the case fatality rate was ~5%. When HDV superinfection occurs in a person with chronic hepatitis B, the likelihood of fulminant hepatitis and death is increased substantially. Although the case fatality rate for hepatitis D is not known definitively, in outbreaks of severe HDV superinfection in isolated populations with a high hepatitis B carrier rate, a mortality rate >20% has been recorded. A small proportion of patients with hepatitis A experience relapsing hepatitis weeks to months after apparent recovery from acute hepatitis. Relapses are characterized by recurrence of symptoms, aminotransferase elevations, occasionally jaundice, and fecal excretion of HAV. Another unusual variant of acute hepatitis A is cholestatic hepatitis, characterized by protracted cholestatic jaundice and pruritus. Rarely, liver test abnormalities persist for many months, even up to a year. Even when these complications occur, hepatitis A remains self-limited and does not progress to chronic liver disease. During the prodromal phase of acute hepatitis B, a serum sickness–like syndrome characterized by arthralgia or arthritis, rash, angioedema, and rarely, hematuria and proteinuria may develop in 5–10% of patients. This syndrome occurs before the onset of clinical jaundice, and these patients are often diagnosed erroneously as having rheumatologic diseases.', 'The HBV must become established first to provide the HBsAg, which is necessary for production of complete HDV virions. Coinfection with HBV and HDV is associated with higher rates of severe acute hepatitis and fulminant liver failure, particularly in intravenous drug abusers, and higher rates of progression to chronic infection, which is often complicated by emergence of liver cancer. Superinfection of a chronic HBV carrier by HDV. The superinfection presents 30 to 50 days later as severe acute hepatitis in a previously unrecognized HBV carrier or as an exacerbation of preexisting chronic hepatitis B. Chronic HDV infection occurs in 80% to 90% of such patients. The superinfection may have two phases: an acute phase with active HDV replication and suppression of HBV with high ALT levels, followed by a chronic phase in which HDV replication decreases, HBV replication increases, ALT levels fluctuate, and the disease progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. HDV infection occurs worldwide and affects an estimated 15 million individuals (about 5% of the 300 million individuals infected by HBV). Its prevalence varies, being highest in the Amazon basin, Africa, the Middle East, and Southern Italy, and lowest in Southeast Asia and China. In most western countries, it is largely restricted to intravenous drug abusers and those who have had multiple blood transfusions. HDV RNA is detectable in the blood and liver at the time of onset of acute symptomatic disease. IgM anti-HDV is a reliable indicator of recent HDV exposure, but is frequently short-lived. Acute coinfection by HDV and HBV is associated with the presence of IgM against HDAg and HBcAg (denoting new infection with hepatitis B). With chronic delta hepatitis arising from HDV superinfection, HBsAg is present in serum, and anti-HDV antibodies (IgG and IgM) persist for months or longer. Because of its dependency on HBV, HDV infection is prevented by vaccination against HBV. HEV is an enterically transmitted, water-borne infection that usually produces a self-limiting disease. The virus typically infects young to middle-aged adults. HEV is a zoonotic disease with animal reservoirs that include monkeys, cats, pigs, and dogs. Epidemics have been reported in Asia and the Indian subcontinent, sub-Saharan Africa, and Mexico, and sporadic cases are seen in Western nations, particularly where pig farming is common and in travelers returning from regions of high incidence. Of greater importance, HEV infection accounts for 30% to 60% of cases of sporadic acute hepatitis in India, exceeding the frequency of HAV. A characteristic feature of HEV infection is the high mortality rate among pregnant women, approaching 20%. In most cases, HEV is not associated with chronic liver disease or persistent viremia. The average incubation period following exposure is 4 to 5 weeks. http://ebooksmedicine.net\n\n\n\nDiscovered in 1983, HEV is an unenveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus in the Hepevirus genus. Virions are shed in stool during the acute illness. Before the onset of clinical illness, HEV RNA and HEV virions can be detected by PCR in stool and serum. The onset of rising serum aminotransferases, clinical illness, and elevated IgM anti-HEV titers are virtually simultaneous. Symptoms resolve in 2 to 4 weeks, during which time the IgM titers fall and IgG anti-HEV titers rise. Clinicopathologic Syndromes of Viral Hepatitis\n\n\n\nAs already discussed, infection with hepatitis viruses produces a wide range of outcomes. Acute infection by each of the hepatotropic viruses may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. HAV and HEV do not cause chronic hepatitis, and only a small number of HBV-infected adults develop chronic hepatitis. In contrast, HCV is notorious for producing chronic infections. Fulminant hepatitis is unusual and is seen primarily with HAV, HBV, or HDV infections. Although HBV and HCV are responsible for most cases of chronic hepatitis, there are many other causes of similar clinicopathologic presentations, including autoimmune hepatitis and drugand toxin-induced hepatitis (discussed later). Therefore, serologic and molecular studies are essential for the diagnosis of viral hepatitis and for distinguishing between the various types. Acute Asymptomatic Infection With Recovery. Patients in this group are identified incidentally on the basis of elevated serum transaminases or the presence of anti-viral antibodies. HAV and HBV infections, particularly in childhood, are frequently subclinical. Acute Symptomatic Infection With Recovery. Whichever virus is involved, acute disease follows a similar course, consisting of: (1) an incubation period of variable length (see\n\n\n\nTable 16.2 (3) a symptomatic icteric phase; and (4) convalescence. Peak infectivity occurs during the last asymptomatic days of the incubation period and the early days of acute symptoms. Fulminant Hepatic Failure. Viral hepatitis is responsible for about 12% of cases of fulminant hepatic failure; of these, two-thirds are caused by HBV infection and the rest by HAV. Survival for more than 1 week may permit recovery to occur via replication of residual hepatocytes. Activation of the stem/progenitor cells in the canals of Hering gives rise to very prominent ductular reactions but is usually insufficient to accomplish full restitution. Fulminant hepatic failure that follows acute viral hepatitis is treated supportively. Liver transplantation is the only option for patients whose disease does not resolve, as death from secondary infections and failure of other organs is otherwise inevitable. 6 months.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['As described above, serologic tests are available routinely with which to establish a diagnosis of hepatitis A, B, D, and C. Tests for fecal or serum HAV are not routinely available. Therefore, a diagnosis of hepatitis A is based on detection of IgM anti-HAV during acute illness (Fig. 360-2). Rheumatoid factor can give rise to false-positive results in this test.\n\n\n\nA diagnosis of HBV infection can usually be made by detection of HBsAg in serum. Infrequently, levels of HBsAg are too low to be detected during acute HBV infection, even with contemporary, highly sensitive immunoassays. In such cases, the diagnosis can be established by the presence of IgM anti-HBc.', 'Serologic Tests of Patient’s Serum\n\n\n\nNote: See text for abbreviations.\n\n\n\nthe absence of HBsAg when IgM anti-HBc is detectable.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies. Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions.', 'Microcephaly and macrocephaly represent an occipitofrontal circumference 2 standard deviations (SDs) below or above the mean, respectively. Measurements plotted over time may show an accelerating pattern (hydrocephalus) or decelerating pattern (brain injury, degenerative neurologic disorder). The anterior fontanelle is slightly depressed and pulsatile when a calm infant is placed upright. A tense or bulging fontanelle may indicate increased intracranial pressure (ICP) but may also be seen in a crying or febrile infant. Premature closure of one or more sutures (craniosynostosis) results in an unusual shape of the head. Abnormal shape, location, and condition of the face, eyes, nares, philtrum, lips, or ears are found in many genetic syndromes. A careful ocular examination is essential and should include a search for epicanthal folds, coloboma, conjunctival telangiectasias, and cataracts. Direct ophthalmoscopy assesses the optic disks and macula for abnormalities such as papilledema or a cherry-red spot. A complete examination of the retina involves dilating the pupil and use of indirect ophthalmoscopy, typically requiring ophthalmologic consultation. Examination of the hands and feet may reveal abnormal creases or digits (Chapters 50, 201). The neck and spine should be examined for obvious (myelomeningocele) or subtle (cutaneous dimples, sinus tracts, hair tufts, subcutaneous lipomas) midline defects. Nervous system abnormalities may result in kyphosis or scoliosis (Chapter 202). Because of the developmental immaturity of infants, the neonatal neurologic examination primarily assesses the function of the basal ganglia, brainstem, and more caudal structures. The plasticity of the developing nervous system means that examination results should be used cautiously in predicting developmental outcomes. A healthy newborn infant should have periods of quiet, sustained wakefulness interspersed with active and quiet sleep.

Examination of the primitive reflexes provides assessment of the functional integrity of the brainstem and basal ganglia (Table 179-1). Many of these stereotyped motor responses are present at birth. They are symmetrical and disappear at 4 to 6 months of age, indicating the normal maturation of descending inhibitory cerebral influences. The grasp and rootingreflexes are inhibited by maturation of frontal lobes but may reappear later in life with acquired frontal lobe lesions. Asymmetry or persistence of the primitive reflexes may indicate focal brain or peripheral nerve lesions. Posture is the position that a calm infant naturally assumes when placed supine. An infant at 28 weeks of gestation shows an extended posture. By 32 weeks, there is a slight trend toward increase in tone and flexion of the lower extremities. At 34 weeks, the lower extremities are flexed; the upper extremities are extended. The term infant flexes lower and upper extremities. Recoil, the readiness with which an arm or leg springs back to its original position after passive stretching and release, is essentially absent in very premature infants but is brisk at term. Because of the asymmetric tonic neck reflex, it is essential to maintain the infant’s head in a neutral position (not turned to the side) during assessment of posture and tone. Spontaneous movements of premature infants are slow and writhing; those of term infants are more rapid. The purpose of the neurologic examination is to localize or identify the region within the neuraxis from which the symptoms arise. The mental status examination assesses the cerebral cortex. The cranial nerve examination evaluates the integrity of the brainstem. The motor examination evaluates upper and lower motor neuron function. The sensory examination assesses the peripheral sensory receptorsand their central reflections. Deep tendon reflexes assess upper and lower motor connections. Gait assessment evaluates the motor system in a dynamic state for better functional assessment. Alertness is assessed in infants by observing spontaneousactivities, feeding behavior, and visual ability to fix and follow objects. Response to tactile, visual, and auditory stimuliis noted. If consciousness is altered, the response to painful stimuli is noted. Observation of toddlers at play allowsa nonthreatening assessment of developmentally appropriate skills. In addition to language function, older childrencan be tested for reading, writing, numerical skills, fundof knowledge, abstract reasoning, judgment, humor, and memory. The simplest way to assess intellectual abilities is through language skills. Language function is receptive (understanding speech or gestures) and expressive (speech and use of gestures). Abnormalities of language resulting from cerebral hemisphere disorders are referred to as aphasias. Anterior, expressive, or Broca aphasia is characterized by sparse, non-fluent language. Posterior, receptive, or Wernicke aphasia is characterized by an inability to understand language, with speech that is fluent but nonsensical. Global aphasia refers to impaired expressive and receptive language. The cranial nerve evaluation assesses brainstem integrity but depends on the stage of brain maturation and the ability to cooperate. A colorful toy may capture a young child’s attention and permit observation of coordination, movement, and cranial nerve function. Smell can be assessed in verbal, cooperative children older than2 years of age. Aromatic substances (perfumes, vanilla) shouldbe used instead of volatile substances (ammonia), which irritate the nasal mucosa and stimulate the trigeminal nerve. Full-term newborns in a quiet awake state follow human faces,lights in a dark room, or large, opticokinetic strips. Visual acuity has been estimated to be 20/200 in newborns and 20/20 in6-month-old infants. Standard visual charts displaying picturesinstead of letters can be used to assess visual acuity in toddlers.Peripheral vision is tested by surreptitiously bringing objectsinto the visual field from behind. A reduced pupillary reactionto light suggests anterior visual pathway lesions, including theretina, optic nerves, and chiasm.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['The disease may be evident at the time of birth (the diagnosis has been made by CT or MRI in neonates), but more often the infant is judged at first to be normal. In approximately 75 percent of cases, attention is drawn to the disease initially by the occurrence of focal or generalized seizures or by slowed psychomotor development. As with any condition that leads to developmental delay, the first suspicion is raised by delay in reaching normal maturational milestones. Whatever the initial symptom, the convulsive disorder and developmental delay become more prominent within 2 to 3 years. The facial cutaneous abnormality, adenoma sebaceum, appears later in childhood, usually between the fourth and tenth years, and is progressive thereafter.', 'A thorough history and physical examination is frequently sufficient to narrow the differential diagnosis and elicit the diagnosis.

Increased lung volumes and flattening of the diaphragm suggest hyperinflation but do not provide information about chronicity of the changes. Computed tomography (CT) scan is the current definitive test for establishing the presence or absence of emphysema in living subjects (Fig. 314-4). From a practical perspective, the CT scan currently does little to influence therapy of COPD except in individuals considering surgical therapy for their disease (described below) and as screening for lung cancer. Recent guidelines have suggested testing for α1AT deficiency in all subjects with COPD or asthma with chronic airflow obstruction. Measurement of the serum α1AT level is a reasonable initial test. For subjects with low α1AT levels, the definitive diagnosis of α1AT deficiency requires protease inhibitor (PI) type determination.

","['47e. Diagnosis Acute pulmonary edema usually presents with the rapid onset of dyspnea at rest, tachypnea, tachycardia, and severe hypoxemia. Crackles and wheezing due to alveolar flooding and airway compression from peribronchial cuffing may be audible. Release of endogenous catecholamines often causes hypertension. It is often difficult to distinguish between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic causes of acute pulmonary edema. Echocardiography may identify systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction and valvular lesions. Electrocardiographic ST elevation and evolving Q waves are usually diagnostic of acute MI and should prompt immediate institution of MI protocols and coronary artery reperfusion therapy (Chap. 295). Brain natriuretic peptide levels, when substantially elevated, support heart failure as the etiology of acute dyspnea with pulmonary edema (Chap. 279). The use of a Swan-Ganz catheter permits measurement of PCWP and helps differentiate high-pressure (cardiogenic) from normal-pressure (noncardiogenic) causes of pulmonary edema. Pulmonary artery catheterization is indicated when the etiology of the pulmonary edema is uncertain, when edema is refractory to therapy, or when it is accompanied by hypotension. Data derived from use of a catheter often alter the treatment plan, but no impact on mortality rates has been demonstrated. The treatment of pulmonary edema depends on the specific etiology. As an acute, life-threatening condition, a number of measures must be applied immediately to support the circulation, gas exchange, and lung mechanics. Simultaneously, conditions that frequently complicate pulmonary edema, such as infection, acidemia, anemia, and acute kidney dysfunction, must be corrected. Patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema generally have an identifiable cause of acute LV failure—such as arrhythmia, ischemia/infarction, or myocardial decompensation (Chap. 279)— that may be rapidly treated, with improvement in gas exchange. In contrast, noncardiogenic edema usually resolves much less quickly, and most patients require mechanical ventilation. Oxygen Therapy Support of oxygenation is essential to ensure adequate O2 delivery to peripheral tissues, including the heart. Positive-Pressure Ventilation Pulmonary edema increases the work of breathing and the O2 requirements of this work, imposing a significant physiologic stress on the heart. When oxygenation or ventilation is not adequate in spite of supplemental O2, positive-pressure ventilation by face or nasal mask or by endotracheal intubation should be initiated. Noninvasive ventilation (Chap. 323) can rest the respiratory muscles, improve oxygenation and cardiac function, and reduce the need for intubation. In refractory cases, mechanical ventilation can relieve the work of breathing more completely than can noninvasive ventilation. Mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure can have multiple beneficial effects on pulmonary edema: (1) decreases both preload and afterload, thereby improving cardiac function; (2) redistributes lung water from the intraalveolar to the extraalveolar space, where the fluid interferes less with gas exchange; and (3) increases lung volume to avoid atelectasis. In most forms of pulmonary edema, the quantity of extravascular lung water is determined by both the PCWP and the intravascular volume status. Diuretics The “loop diuretics” furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide are effective in most forms of pulmonary edema, even in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, or hypochloremia. Furosemide is also a venodilator that rapidly reduces preload before any diuresis, and is the diuretic of choice. The initial dose of furosemide should be ≤0.5 mg/kg, but a higher dose (1 mg/kg) is required in patients with renal insufficiency, chronic diuretic use, or hypervol-1763 emia or after failure of a lower dose. Nitrates Nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate act predominantly as venodilators but have coronary vasodilating properties as well.', 'In general, patients with a hypertensive response to pulmonary edema tolerate and benefit from these medications. In normotensive patients, low doses of single agents should be instituted sequentially, as needed. Acute Coronary Syndromes (See also Chap. 295) Acute STEMI complicated by pulmonary edema is associated with in-hospital mortality rates of 20–40%. After immediate stabilization, coronary artery blood flow must be reestablished rapidly. When available, primary PCI is preferable; alternatively, a fibrinolytic agent should be administered. Early coronary angiography and revascularization by PCI or CABG also are indicated for patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. Assist devices may be used selectively as noted for refractory pulmonary edema. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation For patients with acute, severe noncardiogenic edema with a potential rapidly reversible cause, ECMO may be considered as a temporizing supportive measure to achieve adequate gas exchange. Usually venovenous ECMO is used in this setting. Unusual Types of Edema Specific etiologies of pulmonary edema may require particular therapy. Reexpansion pulmonary edema can develop after removal of longstanding pleural space air or fluid. These patients may develop hypotension or oliguria resulting from rapid fluid shifts into the lung. Diuretics and preload reduction are contraindicated, and intravascular volume repletion often is needed while supporting oxygenation and gas exchange. High-altitude pulmonary edema often can be prevented by use of dexamethasone, calcium channel–blocking drugs, or long-acting inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists. Treatment includes descent from altitude, bed rest, oxygen, and, if feasible, inhaled nitric oxide; nifedipine may also be effective. For pulmonary edema resulting from upper airway obstruction, recognition of the obstructing cause is key, because treatment then is to relieve or bypass the obstruction. causes in a person who may or may not have previously recognized heart disease but in whom the time and mode of death are unexpected. The term “sudden,” in the context of SCD, is defined for most clinical and epidemiologic purposes as 1 h or less between a change in clinical status heralding the onset of the terminal clinical event and the cardiac arrest itself. One exception is unwitnessed deaths, in which pathologists may expand the temporal definition to 24 h after the victim was last seen to be alive and stable. Another exception is the variable interval between cardiac arrest and biological death that results from community-based interventions, following which victims may remain biologically alive for days or even weeks after a cardiac arrest that has resulted in irreversible central nervous system damage. Confusion in terms can be avoided by adhering strictly to definitions of cardiovascular collapse, cardiac arrest, and death (Table 327-1). Although cardiac arrest is often potentially reversible by appropriate and timely interventions, death is biologically, legally, and literally an absolute and irreversible event. Biological death may be delayed by interventions, but the relevant pathophysiologic event remains the sudden and unexpected cardiac arrest. Accordingly, for statistical purposes, deaths that occur during hospitalization or within 30 days after resuscitated cardiac arrest are counted as sudden deaths. The majority of natural deaths are caused by cardiac disorders. However, it is common for underlying heart diseases—often far advanced—to go unrecognized before the fatal event. As a result, up to two-thirds of all SCDs occur as the first clinical expression of previously undiagnosed disease or in patients with known heart disease, the extent of which suggests low individual risk. The magnitude of sudden cardiac death as a public health problem is highlighted by the estimate that ~50% of all cardiac deaths are sudden and unexpected, accounting for a total SCD burden estimated to range from <200,000 to >450,000 deaths each year in the United States. SCD is a direct consequence of cardiac arrest, which may be reversible if addressed promptly. Because resuscitation techniques and emergency rescue systems are available to respond to victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which was uniformly fatal in the past, understanding the SCD problem has practical clinical importance. Cardiovascular collapse is a general term connoting loss of sufficient cerebral blood flow to maintain consciousness due to acute dysfunction of the heart and/or peripheral vasculature. It may be caused by vasodepressor syncope (vasovagal syncope, postural hypotension with syncope, neurocardiogenic syncope; Chap. 27), a transient severe bradycardia, or cardiac arrest. The latter is distinguished from the transient forms of cardiovascular collapse in that it usually requires an active intervention to restore spontaneous blood flow. In contrast, vasodepressor syncope and other primary bradyarrhythmic syncopal events are transient and non-life-threatening, with spontaneous return of consciousness. In the past, the most common electrical mechanism for cardiac arrest was ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless sustained ventricular tachycardia (PVT). These were the initial rhythms recorded in 60–80% of cardiac arrests, with VF being the far more common of the two. Severe persistent bradyarrhythmias, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity (PEA; organized electrical activity, unusually slow, without mechanical response, formerly called electromechanical dissociation [EMD]) caused another 20–30%. Currently, asystole has emerged as the most common mechanism recorded at initial contact (45–50% of cases). PEA accounts for 20–25%, and VF is now present on initial contact in 25–35%. Undoubtedly, a significant proportion of the asystole cases began as VF and deteriorated to asystole because of long response times, but there are data suggesting an absolute reduction in VF as well. Acute low cardiac output states, having a precipitous onset, also may present clinically as a cardiac arrest. These hemodynamic causes include massive acute pulmonary emboli, internal blood loss from a ruptured aortic aneurysm, intense anaphylaxis, and cardiac rupture with tamponade after myocardial infarction (MI). ETIOLOGY, INITIATING EVENTS, AND CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY\n\n\n\nClinical, epidemiologic, and pathologic studies have provided information on the underlying structural substrates in victims of SCD and identified subgroups at high risk for SCD. In addition, studies of clinical physiology have begun to identify transient functional factors that may convert a long-standing underlying structural abnormality from a stable to an unstable state, leading to the onset of cardiac arrest (Table 327-2). Cardiac disorders constitute the most common causes of sudden natural death. After an initial peak incidence of sudden death between birth and 6 months of age (sudden infant death syndrome [SIDS]), the incidence of sudden death declines sharply and remains low through childhood and adolescence. Among adolescents and young adults, the incidence of SCD is approximately 1 per 100,000 population per year. The incidence begins to increase in adults over age 30 years, reaching a second peak in the age range of 45–75 years, when it approximates 1–2 per 1000 per year among the unselected adult population.

","['The physiologic stability of the patient may be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, manifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most ominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of jaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate a coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest infiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests an anemia of chronic disease. An essential element of the physical examination is the investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood. A hemoglobin or hematocrit test indicates the severity of the anemia. Once anemia has been substantiated, the workup should include a complete blood count with differential, platelet count, indices, and reticulocyte count. Examination of the peripheral blood smear assesses the morphology of RBCs (Fig. 150-2), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. All cell lines should be scrutinized to determine whether anemia is the result of a process limited to the erythroid line or a process that affects other marrow elements. Using data obtained from the indices and reticulocyte count, the workup can be organized on the basis of whether RBC production is adequate or inadequate and whether the cells are microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (see Fig. 150-1). An appropriate bone marrow response to anemia would be an elevated absolute reticulocyte number, suggestingincreased production and implying either hemolysis orblood loss. Anemia with a normal reticulocyte number suggests decreased or ineffective production for the degree ofanemia. Reticulocytopenia signifies an acute onset so thatthe marrow has not had adequate time to respond, thatreticulocytes are being destroyed in the marrow (antibodymediated), or that intrinsic bone marrow disease is present.The best indicators of the severity of hemolysis are the hemoglobin level and the elevation of the reticulocyte count. Biochemical evidence of hemolysis includes an increase inlevels of bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase and a decreasein haptoglobin.

SCD represents a qualitative defect in the β-globin chain. Patients with SCD classically get osteomyelitis with Salmonella. They are also at ↑ risk of avascular necrosis of the hip. Blood transfusion and stem cell transplantation to replace absent cells; immunosuppression with cyclosporin A and antithymocyte globulin to prevent autoimmune destruction of marrow. Infections are a major cause of mortality and should be treated aggressively. An autosomal-recessive disorder most commonly caused by a mutation of adult hemoglobin (the β chain has glu replaced by val). Signs and symptoms are due to ↓ red cell survival and a tendency of sickled cells to lead to vasoocclusion. Asymptomatic during the first year or two of life; may first present with dactylitis in childhood. Later, hemolysis results in anemia, jaundice, cholelithiasis, ↑ cardiac output (murmur and cardiomegaly), and delayed growth. Vaso-occlusion leads to ischemic organ damage, especially splenic infarction, which predisposes to pneumococcal sepsis, and acute chest syndrome (pneumonia and/or pulmonary infarction). Patients also experience painful crises of unknown etiology. Common triggers for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) include cold temperatures, dehydration, and infection. Other potential complications include splenic sequestration, which occurs in patients who have not infarcted their spleens, and aplastic crisis, which is usually 2° to infection with parvovirus B19. The sickle cell screen is based on a blood smear with sickle cells and target cells. The gold standard is quantitative hemoglobin electrophoresis. Treat with hydroxyurea, which stimulates the production of fetal hemoglobin (hydroxyurea is teratogenic, so it is contraindicated in pregnancy). If hydroxyurea does not prove effective, chronic transfusion therapy, which carries the risk of iron overload, can be tried. Treat cholelithiasis with cholecystectomy. VOCs must be treated with adequate pain management, O2 therapy, IV ﬂuid rehydration, and antibiotics (if infection is suspected to be the trigger). To prevent VOCs from progressing to acute chest syndrome, initiate aggressive hydration and incentive spirometry, and keep the sickle variant < 40%. This can be done with simple transfusions or, if necessary, exchange transfusion in an ICU setting. Hereditary disorders involving ↓ or absent production of normal globin chains of hemoglobin. α-thalassemia is caused by a mutation of one or more of the four genes for α-hemoglobin; β-thalassemia results from a mutation of one or both of the two genes for β-hemoglobin. Thalassemia is most common among people of African, Middle Eastern, and Asian descent. Disease presentation and prognosis vary with the number of genes missing (see Table 2.7-5). Diagnosed by hemoglobin electrophoresis evaluation (but note that this is normal in α-thalassemia) and DNA studies. Most patients do not require treatment, but those with β-thalassemia major and hemoglobin H disease are commonly transfusion dependent and should be given iron chelators (deferoxamine) to prevent overload. Erythrocytosis (an abnormal elevation of hematocrit) may be either 1° (due to ↑ RBC production) or 2° (due to ↓ plasma volume and hemoconcentration). T AB LE 2.7 -5. Differential Diagnosis of Thalassemias β-thalassemia major 0/2 β Patients develop severe microcytic anemia in the frst year of life and need chronic transfusions or marrow transplant to survive. β-thalassemia minor 1/2 β Patients are asymptomatic, but their cells are microcytic and hypochromic on peripheral smear. Hydrops fetalis 0/4 α Patients die in utero. Hemoglobin H disease 1/4 α Patients have severe hypochromic, microcytic anemia with chronic hemolysis, splenomegaly, jaundice, and cholelithiasis. The reticulocyte count elevates to compensate, and one-third of patients have skeletal changes due to expanded erythropoiesis. α-thalassemia trait 2/4 α Patients have low MCV but are usually asymptomatic. Silent carrier 3/4 α Patients have no signs or symptoms of disease. True polycythemia vera is characterized by a high red cell mass. Premedication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine is sometimes used to prevent transfusion reactions. Hemoglobinuria in hemolytic transfusion reaction may lead to acute tubular necrosis and subsequent renal failure. Characterized by ↑ hematocrit, ↓ tissue blood ﬂow and oxygenation, and ↑ cardiac work. Patients present with “hyperviscosity syndrome,” which consists of easy bleeding/bruising, blurred vision, neurologic abnormalities, plethora, pruritus (especially after a warm bath), hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and CHF. 1° erythrocytosis is associated with hypoxia (from lung disease, smoking, high altitudes, or a poor intrauterine environment), neoplasia (erythropoietin-producing tumors), or polycythemia vera (PCV), in which there is clonal proliferation of a pluripotent marrow stem cell. 2° erythrocytosis is associated with excessive diuresis, severe gastroenteritis, and burns. Erythrocytosis is diagnosed clinically and by cell counts, with ABGs used to assess hypoxia or imaging to demonstrate neoplasia. Patients with PCV have excess RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. Levels of erythropoietin may be useful in distinguishing PCV, in which levels are low, from other causes of polycythemia. Phlebotomy relieves symptoms of erythrocytosis, but treatment should also address the underlying cause. PCV can be treated with cytoreductive drugs such as hydroxyurea or interferon. Because PCV is prothrombotic, ASA should also be used. With treatment, survival is 7–10 years. Blood transfusion is generally safe but may result in a variety of adverse reactions. Nonhemolytic febrile reactions and minor allergic reactions are the most common, each occurring in 3–4% of all transfusions. Etiologies are as follows:\n\n\n\nNonhemolytic febrile reactions: Involve cytokine formation during the storage of blood, and WBC antibodies. Minor allergic reactions: Involve antibody formation (usually IgA) against donor proteins. Usually occur following transfusion of plasma-containing product. Hemolytic transfusion reactions: Entail the development of antibodies against donor erythrocytes. Usually result from ABO incompatibility or from antibody against minor antigens. Nonhemolytic febrile reactions: Present with fever, chills, rigors, and malaise. Symptom onset is 1–6 hours following transfusion. Minor allergic reactions: Characterized by urticaria. Hemolytic transfusion reactions: Present with fever, chills, nausea, ﬂ ushing, apprehension, back pain, burning at the IV site, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Symptoms begin following the transfusion of only a small amount of blood. Diagnosed by clinical impression. Nonhemolytic febrile reactions: Stop the transfusion and control fever with acetaminophen. Rule out infection. Minor allergic reactions: Administer antihistamines. In the setting of a severe reaction, stop the transfusion and give epinephrine +/– steroids. Hemolytic transfusion reactions: Stop the transfusion immediately. Replace donor blood with normal saline; administer vigorous IV ﬂ uids; and maintain good urine output (diuretics and pressors may be used to ↑ renal blood ﬂ ow). The porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders that include acute intermittent porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, and erythropoietic porphyria. Some porphyrias are autosomal dominant (e.g., acute intermittent porphyria) and others autosomal recessive (e.g., erythropoietic porphyria). All involve abnormalities of heme production that lead to an accumulation of porphyrins. Signs and symptoms vary with the type of porphyria. In general, however, porphyrias are characterized by a combination of photodermatitis, neuropsychiatric complaints, and visceral complaints that typically take the form of a colicky abdominal pain and seizures. Physical exam reveals tachycardia, skin erythema and blisters, aref exia, and a nonspecifc abdominal exam. Patients with the erythropoietic form present with hemolytic anemia. Acute attacks are associated with stimulants of ↑ heme synthesis such as fasting or chemical exposures; well-known triggers are alcohol, barbiturates, and OCPs. Urine may appear red or brown after an acute attack. Patients may have a  family history.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Table 149-1 Presentation of Hematologic Disorders CONDITION SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS COMMON EXAMPLES Anemia Pallor, fatigue, heart failure, jaundice Iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia Polycythemia Irritability, cyanosis, seizures, jaundice, stroke, headache Cyanotic heart disease, infant of diabetic mother, cystic fibrosis\n\n\n\nNeutropenia Fever, pharyngitis, oral ulceration, cellulitis, Congenital or drug-induced agranulocytosis, leukemia lymphadenopathy, bacteremia, gingivitis\n\n\n\nThrombocytopenia Petechiae, ecchymosis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, ITP, leukemia epistaxis\n\n\n\nCoagulopathy Bruising, hemarthrosis, mucosal bleeding von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, DIC\n\n\n\nThrombosis Pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis Lupus anticoagulant; protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiency; factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210\n\n\n\nDIC, Disseminated intravascular coagulation; ITP, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.', 'An overriding principle is to initiate treatment of mild to moderate anemia only when a specific diagnosis is made.

","['45. granulosa cells increases and is correlated with an increased number of LH receptors on the free antral surface. Extracellular, densely staining, PAS-positive material called Call-Exner bodies (see Fig. 23.6a) may be seen between the granulosa cells. These bodies are secreted by granulosa cells and contain hyaluronan and proteoglycans. The mature or Graafian follicle contains the mature secondary oocyte. The mature follicle, also known as a Graafan follicle, has a diameter of 10 mm or more. Because of its large size, it extends through the full thickness of the ovarian cortex and causes a bulge on the surface of the ovary. As the follicle nears its maximum size, the mitotic activity of the granulosa cells decreases. The stratum granulosum appears to become thinner as the antrum increases in size. As the spaces between the granulosa cells continue to enlarge, the oocyte and cumulus cells are gradually loosened from the rest of the granulosa cells in preparation for ovulation. The cumulus cells immediately surrounding the oocyte now form a single layer of cells of the corona radiata. These cells and loosely attached cumulus cells remain with the oocyte at ovulation. During this period of follicle maturation, the thecal layers become more prominent. Lipid droplets appear in the cytoplasm of the theca interna cells, and the cells demonstrate ultrastructural features associated with steroid-producing cells. In humans, LH stimulates the cells of the theca interna to secrete androgens, which serve as estrogen precursors. Some androgens are transported to the smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (sER) in the granulosa cells. In response to FSH, the granulosa cells catalyze the conversion of androgens to estrogens, which in turn stimulate the granulosa cells to proliferate and thereby increase the size of the follicle. Increased estrogen levels from both follicular and systemic sources are correlated with increased sensitization of gonadotropes to gonadotropin-releasing hormone. A surge in the release of FSH or LH is induced in the adenohypophysis approximately 24 hours before ovulation. In response to the LH surge, LH receptors on granulosa cells are downregulated (desensitized), and granulosa cells no longer produce estrogens in response to LH. Triggered by this surge, the first meiotic division of the primary oocyte resumes. This event occurs between 12 and 24 hours after the LH surge, resulting in the formation of the secondary oocyte and the first polar body. The granulosa and thecal cells then undergo luteinization and produce progesterone (see page 839, section on the corpus luteum). Ovulation is a hormone-mediated process resulting in the release of the secondary oocyte. Ovulation is the process by which a secondary oocyte is released from the Graafian follicle. The follicle destined to ovulate in any menstrual cycle is recruited from a cohort of several primary follicles in the first few days of the cycle. During ovulation, the oocyte traverses the entire follicular wall, including the germinal epithelium. A combination of hormonal changes and enzymatic effects is responsible for the actual release of the secondary oocyte in the middle of the menstrual cycle (i.e., on the 14th day of a 28-day cycle). These factors include: \x81 Increase in the volume and pressure of the follicular fluid \x81 Enzymatic proteolysis of the follicular wall by activated plasminogen\x81 Hormonally directed deposition of glycosaminoglycans between the oocyte–cumulus complex and the stratum granulosum\x81 Contraction of the smooth muscle fibers in the theca externa layer, triggered by prostaglandins\n\n\n\nJust before ovulation, blood flow stops in a small area of the ovarian surface overlying the bulging follicle. This area of the germinal epithelium, known as the macula pellucida or follicular stigma, becomes elevated and then ruptures (Fig. 23.8a). The oocyte, surrounded by the corona radiata and cells of the cumulus oophorus, is released from the ruptured follicle. At the time of ovulation, the fimbriae of the uterine tube become closely apposed to the surface of the ovary, and the cumulus mass containing oocyte is then gently swept by the fimbriae into the abdominal ostium of the uterine tube. The cumulus mass firmly adheres to the fimbriae and is actively transported by the ciliated cells lining the uterine tube, preventing its passage into the peritoneal cavity. Recently, nonsurgical ultrasound technology is being used to monitor ovarian follicle development. Transvaginal ultrasound examination can provide detailed information about\n\n\n\nFIGURE 23.8 • Endoscopic and ultrasound examination of the ovary. a.

The finding of RBC casts in interstitial nephritis has been reported but should prompt a search for glomerular diseases (Fig. 61-1). Occasionally, renal biopsy will be needed to distinguish among these possibilities.

"A 2-week-old neonate in the intensive care unit presents as severely ill. His mother says he was a bit irritated earlier this week, and his condition deteriorated quickly. It is apparent that he is in constant pain. He could not be fed easily and vomited three times since yesterday alone. The physical examination is remarkable for a distended abdomen and diminished bowel sounds. The neonate is sent for an abdominal/chest X-ray, which shows substantial intraluminal gas affecting most of the bowel. The neonate was born at 32 weeks of gestation by a normal vaginal delivery.

","['Resuscitative efforts at delivery are often required. It is often necessary to remove ascitic fluid from the abdomen or pleural fluid to improve ventilation. Profound anemia necessitates immediate transfusion with packed red blood cells. The overall mortality for infants with nonimmune hydrops is approximately 50%. If the diagnosis is made before 24 weeks of gestation with subsequent premature delivery, the survival rate is approximately 4% to 6%. Available @ StudentConsult.com\n\n\n\nRespiratory distress that becomes manifested by tachypnea, intercostal retractions, reduced air exchange, cyanosis, expiratory grunting, and nasal flaring is a nonspecific response to serious illness. The differential diagnosis of respiratory distress includes pulmonary, cardiac, hematologic, infectious, anatomic, and metabolic disorders that may involve the lungs directly or indirectly. Surfactant deficiency causes respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), resulting in cyanosis and tachypnea; infection produces pneumonia, shown by interstitial or lobar infiltrates; meconium aspiration results in a chemical pneumonitis with hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension; hydrops fetalis causes anemia and hypoalbuminemia with high-output heart failure and pulmonary edema; and congenital or acquired pulmonary hypoplasia causes pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary insufficiency. It also is clinically useful to differentiate the common causes of respiratory distress according to gestational age (Table 61-1). In addition to the specific therapy for the individual disorder, supportive care and evaluation of the infant with respiratory distress can be applied to all the problems mentioned earlier (Table 61-2). Blood gas monitoring and interpretation are key components of general respiratory care. Treatment of hypoxemia requires knowledge of normal values. In term infants, the arterial Pao2 level is 55 to 60 mm Hg at 30 minutes of life, 75 mm Hg at 4 hours, and 90 mm Hg at 24 hours. Preterm infants have lower values. Paco2 levels should be 35 to 40 mm Hg, and the pH should be 7.35 to 7.40. It is imperative that arterial blood gas analysis be performed in all infants with significant respiratory distress, whether or not cyanosis is perceived. Cyanosis becomes evident when there is 5 g of unsaturated hemoglobin; anemia may interfere with the perception of cyanosis. Jaundice also may interfere with the appearance of cyanosis. Capillary blood gas determinations are useful in determining blood pH and the Paco2 level but may result in falsely low blood Pao2 readings. Serial blood gas levels may be monitored by an indwelling arterial catheter placed in a peripheral artery or through the umbilical artery. Another method for monitoring blood gas levels is to combine capillary blood gas techniques with noninvasive methods used\n\n\n\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension of the neonate* Meconium aspiration pneumonia* Polycythemia Amniotic fluid aspiration\n\n\n\nBacterial sepsis (GBS)* Transient tachypnea* Spontaneous pneumothorax Congenital anomalies (e.g., congenital lobar emphysema, cystic adenomatoid malformation, diaphragmatic hernia) Congenital heart disease Pulmonary hypoplasia Viral infection (e.g., herpes simplex, CMV) Inborn metabolic errors\n\n\n\nCMV, Cytomegalovirus; GBS, group B streptococcus. *Common.

Metabolic acidosis, defined as a reduced pH (<7.25) and bicarbonate concentration (<18 mEq/L) accompanied by a normal or low Pco2 level, may be caused by hypoxia or by insufficient tissue perfusion. The origin of the disorder may be pulmonary, cardiac, infectious, renal, hematologic, nutritional, metabolic, or iatrogenic. The initial approach to metabolic acidosis is to determine the cause and treat the pathophysiologic problem. This approach may include, as in the sequence of therapy for hypoxia, increasing the inspired oxygen concentration; applying continuous positive airway pressure nasally; or initiating mechanical ventilation using positive end-expiratory pressure. Patients with hypotension produced by hypovolemia require fluids and may need inotropic or vasoactive drug support. If metabolic acidosis persists despite specific therapy, sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg/dose) may be given by slow intravenous infusion. Near-normal or low Pco2 levels should be documented before sodium bicarbonate infusion. The buffering effect of sodium bicarbonate results in increased Pco2 levels, unless adequate ventilation is maintained. Respiratory acidosis, defined as an elevated Pco2 level and reduced pH without a reduction in the bicarbonate concentration, may be caused by pulmonary insufficiency or central hypoventilation. Most disorders producing respiratory distress can lead to hypercapnia. Treatment involves assisted ventilation but not sodium bicarbonate. If central nervous system depression of respirations is caused by placental passage of narcotic analgesics, assisted ventilation is instituted first, then the central nervous system depression is reversed by naloxone. RDS occurs after the onset of breathing and is associated with an insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant. The lining of the alveolus consists of 90% type I cells and 10% type II cells. After 20 weeks of gestation, the type II cells contain vacuolated, osmophilic, lamellar inclusion bodies, which are packages of surface-active material (Fig. 61-1). This lipoprotein surfactant is 90% lipid and is composed predominantly of saturated phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), but also contains phosphatidylglycerol, other phospholipids, and neutral lipids. The surfactant proteins, SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D, are packaged into the lamellar body and contribute to surface-active properties and recycling of surfactant. Surfactant prevents atelectasis by reducing surface tension at low lung volumes when it is concentrated at end expiration as the alveolar radius decreases; surfactant contributes to lung recoil by increasing surface tension at larger lung volumes when it is diluted during inspiration as the alveolar radius increases. Without surfactant, surface tension forces are not reduced, and atelectasis develops during end expiration as the alveolus collapses. The timing of surfactant production in quantities sufficient to prevent atelectasis depends on an increase in fetal cortisol levels that begins between 32 and 34 weeks of gestation. By 34 to 36 weeks, sufficient surface-active material is produced by the type II cells in the lung, is secreted into the alveolar lumen, and is excreted into the amniotic fluid. The concentration of\n\n\n\nFigure 61-1 Proposed pathway of synthesis, transport, secretion, and reuptake of surfactant in the type II alveolar cell. Phospholipids are synthesized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The glucose/ glycerol precursor may be derived from lung glycogen or circulating glucose. Phospholipids and surfactant proteins are packaged in the Golgi apparatus (GZ), emerge as small lamellar bodies (SLB), coalesce to mature lamellar bodies (MLB), migrate to the apical membrane, and are released by exocytosis into the liquid hypophase below the air-liquid interface. The tightly coiled lamellar body unravels to form the lattice (tubular) myelin figure (LMF), the immediate precursor to the phospholipid monolayer at the alveolar surface. Reuptake by endocytosis forms multivesicular bodies (MVB) that recycle surfactant. The enzymes, receptors, transporters, and surfactant proteins are controlled by regulatory processes at the transcriptional level in the nucleus (N). Corticosteroid and thyroid hormones are regulatory ligands that may accelerate surfactant synthesis. (From Hansen T, Corbet A: Lung development and function. In Taeusch HW, Ballard R, Avery ME, editors: Diseases of the Newborn, ed 6, Philadelphia, 1991, Saunders, p 465.) lecithin in amniotic fluid indicates fetal pulmonary maturity. Because the amount of lecithin is difficult to quantify, the ratio of lecithin (which increases with maturity) to sphingomyelin (which remains constant during gestation) (L/S ratio) is determined. An L/S ratio of 2:1 usually indicates pulmonary maturity. The presence of minor phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol, also is indicative of fetal lung maturity and may be useful in situations in which the L/S ratio is borderline or possibly affected by maternal diabetes, which reduces lung maturity. The absence of phosphatidylglycerol suggests that surfactant might not be mature. A deficiency of pulmonary surfactant (most often due to prematurity) results in atelectasis, decreased functional residual capacity, arterial hypoxemia, and respiratory distress. Surfactant synthesis may also be reduced as a result of hypovolemia, hypothermia, acidosis, hypoxemia, and rare genetic disorders of surfactant synthesis. These factors also produce pulmonary artery vasospasm, which may contribute to RDS in larger premature infants who have developed sufficient pulmonary arteriole smooth muscle to produce vasoconstriction. Surfactant deficiency–induced atelectasis causes alveoli to be perfused but not ventilated, which results in a pulmonary shunt and hypoxemia. As atelectasis increases, the lungs become increasingly difficult to expand, and lung compliance decreases. Because the chest wall of the premature infant is very compliant, the infant attempts to overcome decreased lung compliance with increasing inspiratory pressures, resulting in retractions of the chest wall. The sequence of decreased lung compliance and chest wall retractions leads to poor air exchange, an increased physiologic dead space, alveolar hypoventilation, and hypercapnia. A cycle of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis acts on type II cells to reduce surfactant synthesis and, in some infants, on the pulmonary arterioles to produce pulmonary hypertension. Infants at greatest risk for RDS are premature and have an immature L/S ratio.', 'The Pao2 level should be maintained between 60 and 70 mm Hg (oxygen saturation 90%), and the pH should be maintained above 7.25. An increased concentration of warm and humidified inspired oxygen administered by a nasal cannula or an oxygen hood may be all that is needed for larger premature infants. If hypoxemia (Pao2 <50 mm Hg) is present, and the needed inspired oxygen concentration is 70% to 100%, nasal continuous positive airway pressure should be added at\n\n\n\nCentral nervous IVH, drugs, seizures, hypoxic injury system\n\n\n\nRespiratory Pneumonia, obstructive airway lesions, atelectasis, extreme prematurity (<1000 g), laryngeal reflex, phrenic nerve paralysis, severe RDS, pneumothorax\n\n\n\nInfectious Sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, meningitis (bacterial, fungal, viral)\n\n\n\nGastrointestinal Oral feeding, bowel movement, gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, intestinal perforation\n\n\n\nMetabolic ↓ Glucose, ↓ calcium, ↓ PO2, ↓↑ sodium, ↑ ammonia, ↑ organic acids, ↑ ambient temperature, hypothermia\n\n\n\nCardiovascular Hypotension, hypertension, heart failure, anemia, hypovolemia, change in vagal tone\n\n\n\nIdiopathic Immaturity of respiratory center, sleep state, upper airway collapse\n\n\n\nIVH, Intraventricular hemorrhage; RDS, respiratory distress syndrome. a distending pressure of 8 to 10 cm H2O. If respiratory failure ensues (Pco2 >60 mm Hg, pH <7.20, and Pao2 <50 mm Hg with 100% oxygen), assisted ventilation using a ventilator is indicated. Conventional rate (25 to 60 breaths/min), high-frequency jet (150 to 600 breaths/min), and oscillatory (900 to 3000 breaths/min) ventilators all have been successful in managing respiratory failure caused by severe RDS. Suggested starting settings on a conventional ventilator are fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.60 to 1.0; peak inspiratory pressure, 20 to 25 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm H2O; and respiratory rate, 30 to 50 breaths/min. In response to persistent hypercapnia, alveolar ventilation (tidal volume − dead space × rate) must be increased. Ventilation can be increased by an increase in the ventilator’s rate or an increase in the tidal volume (the gradient between peak inspiratory pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure using a pressure-controlled ventilator). In response to hypoxia, the inspired oxygen content may be increased. Alternatively, the degree of oxygenation depends on the mean airway pressure. Mean airway pressure is directly related to positive end-expiratory pressure, flow, and inspiratory time. Increased mean airway pressure may improve oxygenation by improving lung volume, enhancing ventilation-perfusion matching. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing sepsis and pneumonia from RDS, broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) are administered for 48 to 72 hours, pending the recovery of an organism from a previously obtained blood culture.

This can be accomplished using high frequency oscil-latory ventilation (HFOV). If the gastric distention becomes severe, a gastrostomy tube should be placed. This procedure can be performed at the bedside under local anesthetic, if necessary. The dilated, air-filled stomach can easily be accessed through an incision in the left-upper quadrant of the abdomen. Once the gastrostomy tube is placed and the abdominal pressure is relieved, the pulmonary status can paradoxically worsen. This is because the ventilated gas may pass preferentially through the fistula, which is the path of least resistance, and bypass the lungs thereby worsening the hypoxemia. To correct this problem, the gastrostomy tube may be placed under water seal, elevated, or intermittently clamped. If these maneuvers are to no avail, liga-tion of the fistula may be required.

","['Cardiac auscultation may reveal a third or, more commonly, a fourth heart sound, reflecting myocardial systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Murmurs of mitral regurgitation or a harsh murmur of a ventricular-septal defect may indicate mechanical complications of STEMI. A murmur of aortic insufficiency may be a complication of proximal aortic dissection. Other murmurs may reveal underlying cardiac disorders contributory to ischemia (e.g., aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Pericardial friction rubs reflect pericardial inflammation. Abdominal Localizing tenderness on the abdominal exam is useful in identifying a gastrointestinal cause of the presenting syndrome. Abdominal findings are infrequent with purely acute cardiopulmonary problems, except in the case of underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease or severe right ventricular dysfunction leading to hepatic congestion. Vascular Pulse deficits may reflect underlying chronic atherosclerosis, which increases the likelihood of coronary artery disease. However, evidence of acute limb ischemia with loss of the pulse and pallor, particularly in the upper extremities, can indicate catastrophic consequences of aortic dissection. Unilateral lower-extremity swelling should raise suspicion about venous thromboembolism. Musculoskeletal Pain arising from the costochondral and chondrosternal articulations may be associated with localized swelling, redness, or marked localized tenderness. Pain on palpation of these joints is usually well localized and is a useful clinical sign, though deep palpation may elicit pain in the absence of costochondritis. Although palpation of the chest wall often elicits pain in patients with various musculoskeletal conditions, it should be appreciated that chest wall tenderness does not exclude myocardial ischemia. Sensory deficits in the upper extremities may be indicative of cervical disk disease. Electrocardiography is crucial in the evaluation of nontraumatic chest discomfort.', 'Lung examination can reveal adventitious sounds indicative of pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or pleuritis. Abdomen In some patients with advanced obstructive lung disease, the point of maximal cardiac impulse may be in the epigastrium. The liver is frequently enlarged and tender in patients with chronic heart failure. Systolic pulsations over the liver signify severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Splenomegaly may be a feature of infective endocarditis, particularly when symptoms have persisted for weeks or months. Ascites is a nonspecific finding but may be present with advanced chronic right heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, hepatic cirrhosis, or an intraperitoneal malignancy. The finding of an elevated JVP implies a cardiovascular etiology. In nonobese patients, the aorta typically is palpated between the epigastrium and the umbilicus. The sensitivity of palpation for the detection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (pulsatile and expansile mass) decreases as a function of body size. Because palpation alone is not sufficiently accurate to establish this diagnosis, a screening ultrasound examination is advised. The 1443 presence of an arterial bruit over the abdomen suggests high-grade atherosclerotic disease, although precise localization is difficult. Extremities The temperature and color of the extremities, the presence of clubbing, arachnodactyly, and pertinent nail findings can be surmised quickly during the examination. Clubbing implies the presence of central right-to-left shunting, although it has also been described in patients with endocarditis. Its appearance can range from cyanosis and softening of the root of the nail bed, to the classic loss of the normal angle between the base of the nail and the skin, to the skeletal and periosteal bony changes of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, which is seen rarely in patients with advanced lung or liver disease. Patients with the Holt-Oram syndrome have an unopposable, “fingerized” thumb, whereas patients with Marfan’s syndrome may have arachnodactyly and a positive “wrist” (overlapping of the thumb and fifth finger around the wrist) or “thumb” (protrusion of the thumb beyond the ulnar aspect of the hand when the fingers are clenched over the thumb in a fist) sign. The Janeway lesions of endocarditis are non- tender, slightly raised hemorrhages on the palms and soles, whereas Osler’s nodes are tender, raised nodules on the pads of the fingers or toes. Splinter hemorrhages are classically identified as linear petechiae in the midposition of the nail bed and should be distinguished from the more common traumatic petechiae, which are seen closer to the distal edge. Lower extremity or presacral edema in the setting of an elevated JVP defines volume overload and may be a feature of chronic heart failure or constrictive pericarditis.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Additional clues to the etiology and importance of a heart murmur can be gleaned from the history and other physical examination findings.

Cardiac arrhythmias are a common problem in clinical practice, occurring in up to 25% of patients treated with digitalis, 50% of anesthetized patients, and over 80% of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Arrhythmias may require treatment because rhythms that are too rapid, too slow, or asynchronous can reduce cardiac output. Some arrhythmias can precipitate more serious or even lethal rhythm disturbances; for example, early premature ventricular depolarizations can precipitate ventricular fibrillation. In such patients, antiarrhythmic drugs may be lifesaving. On the other hand, the hazards of antiarrhythmic drugs—and in particular the fact that they can precipitate lethal arrhythmias in some patients—have led to a reevaluation of their relative risks and benefits. In general, treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic arrhythmias should be avoided for this reason. Arrhythmias can be treated with the drugs discussed in this chapter and with nonpharmacologic therapies such as pacemakers, cardioversion, catheter ablation, and surgery.

Hume, PhD, for his contributions to previous editions. describes the pharmacology of drugs that suppress arrhythmias by a direct action on the cardiac cell membrane. Other modes of therapy are discussed briefly (see Box: The Nonpharmacologic Therapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias, later in the chapter). The electrical impulse that triggers a normal cardiac contraction originates at regular intervals in the sinoatrial (SA) node (Figure 14–1), usually at a frequency of 60–100 bpm. This impulse spreads rapidly through the atria and enters the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles. Conduction through the AV node is slow, requiring about 0.15 seconds. (This delay provides time for atrial contraction to propel blood into the ventricles.) The impulse then propagates down the His-Purkinje system and invades all parts of the ventricles, beginning with the endocardial surface near the apex and ending with the epicardial surface at the base of the heart. Activation of the entire ventricular myocardium is complete\n\n\n\nFIGURE 14–1 Schematic representation of the heart and normal cardiac electrical activity (intracellular recordings from areas indicated and electrocardiogram [ECG]). Sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and Purkinje cells display pacemaker activity (phase 4 depolarization). The ECG is the body surface manifestation of the depolarization and repolarization waves of the heart. The P wave is generated by atrial depolarization, the QRS by ventricular muscle depolarization, and the T wave by ventricular repolarization. Thus, the PR interval is a measure of conduction time from atrium to ventricle, and the QRS duration indicates the time required for all of the ventricular cells to be activated (ie, the intraventricular conduction time). The QT interval reflects the duration of the ventricular action potential. in less than 0.1 second. As a result, ventricular contraction is synchronous and hemodynamically effective. Arrhythmias represent electrical activity that deviates from the above description as a result of an abnormality in impulse initiation and/or impulse propagation. Ionic Basis of Membrane Electrical Activity\n\n\n\nThe electrical excitability of cardiac cells is a function of the unequal distribution of ions across the plasma membrane—chiefly sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl−)—and the relative permeability of the membrane to each ion. The gradients are generated by transport mechanisms that move these ions across the membrane against their concentration gradients. The most important of these transport mechanisms is the Na+/K+-ATPase, or sodium pump, described in Chapter 13. It is responsible for keeping the intracellular sodium concentration low and the intracellular potassium concentration high relative to their respective extracellular concentrations. Other transport mechanisms maintain the gradients for calcium and chloride. As a result of the unequal distribution, when the membrane becomes permeable to a given ion, that ion tends to move down its concentration gradient. However, because of its charged nature, ion movement is also affected by differences in the electrical charge across the membrane, or the transmembrane potential. The potential difference that is sufficient to offset or balance the concentration gradient of an ion is referred to the equilibrium potential (Eion) for that ion, and for a monovalent cation at physiologic temperature, it can be calculated by a modified version of the Nernst equation: where Ce and Ci are the extracellular and intracellular ion concentrations, respectively. Thus, the movement of an ion across the membrane of a cell is a function of the difference between the transmembrane potential and the equilibrium potential. This is also known as the “electrochemical gradient” or “driving force.”\n\n\n\nThe relative permeability of the membrane to different ions determines the transmembrane potential. However, ions contributing to this potential difference are unable to freely diffuse across the lipid membrane of a cell. Their permeability relies on aqueous channels (specific pore-forming proteins). The ion channels that are thought to contribute to cardiac action potentials are illustrated in Figure 14–2. Most channels are relatively ion-specific, and the current generated by the flux of ions through them is controlled by “gates” (flexible portions of the peptide chains that make up the channel proteins). Sodium, calcium, and some potassium channels are thought to have two types of gates—one that opens or activates the channel and another that closes or inactivates the channel. For the majority of the channels responsible for the cardiac action potential, the movement of these gates is controlled by voltage changes across the cell membrane; that is, they are voltage-sensitive. However, certain channels are primarily ligandrather than voltage-gated. Furthermore, the activity of many voltage-gated ion channels can be modulated by a variety of other factors, including permeant ion concentrations, tissue metabolic activity, and second messenger signaling pathways. Pumps and exchangers that contribute indirectly to the membrane potential by creating ion gradients (as discussed above) can also contribute directly because of the current they generate through the unequal exchange of charged ions across the membrane. Such transporters are referred to as being “electrogenic.” An important example is the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX). Throughout most of the cardiac action potential, this exchanger couples the movement of one calcium ion out of the cell for every three sodium ions that move in, thus generating a net inward or depolarizing current. Although this current is typically small during diastole, when intracellular calcium levels are low, spontaneous release of calcium from intracellular storage sites can generate a depolarizing current that contributes to pacemaker activity as well as arrhythmogenic events called delayed afterdepolarizations (see below). The Active Cell Membrane\n\n\n\nIn atrial and ventricular cells, the diastolic membrane potential (phase 4) is typically very stable. This is because it is dominated by a potassium permeability or conductance that is due to the activity of channels that generate an inward-rectifying potassium current (IK1). This keeps the membrane potential near the potassium\n\n\n\nSCN5A/Nav 1.5 Ca2+\n\n\n\nL-type CACNA1/Cav 1.2 current T-type CACNA1G,H/Cav 3.1, 3.2 transient lto,f KCND3/Kv 4.3 outward lto,s KCNA4/Kv 1.4 lKur KCNA5/Kv 1.5 lK,ACh KCNJ3, 5/Kir 3.1, 3.4 lCl CFTR/CFTR inward rectifier, lK1 KCNJ2/Kir 2.1 pacemaker current, lf HCN2, 4/HCN2, 4 Na+/Ca2+ exchange SLC8A1/NCX 1\n\n\n\nNa+/K+-ATPase NKAIN1-4/Na, K-pump\n\n\n\nFIGURE 14–2 Schematic diagram of the ion permeability changes and transport processes that occur during an action potential and the diastolic period following it. Yellow indicates inward (depolarizing) membrane currents; blue indicates outward (repolarizing) membrane currents. Multiple subtypes of potassium and calcium currents, with different sensitivities to blocking drugs, have been identified. The right side of the figure lists the genes and proteins responsible for each type of channel or transporter. equilibrium potential, EK (about –90 mV when Ke = 5 mmol/L and Ki = 150 mmol/L). It also explains why small changes in extracellular potassium concentration have significant effects on the resting membrane potential of these cells. For example, increasing extracellular potassium shifts the equilibrium potential in a positive direction, causing depolarization of the resting membrane potential. It is important to note, however, that potassium is unique in that changes in the extracellular concentration can also affect the permeability of potassium channels, which can produce some nonintuitive effects (see Box: Effects of Potassium). The upstroke (phase 0) of the action potential is due to the inward sodium current (INa). From a functional point of view, the behavior of the channels responsible for this current can be described in terms of three states (Figure 14–3). It is now recognized that these states actually represent different conformations of the channel protein. Depolarization of the membrane by an impulse propagating from adjacent cells results in opening of the activation (m) gates of sodium channels (Figure 14–3, middle), and sodium permeability is markedly increased. Extracellular sodium is then able to diffuse down its electrochemical gradient into the cell, causing the membrane potential to move very rapidly toward the sodium equilibrium potential, ENa (about +70 mV when Nae = 140 mmol/L and Nai = 10 mmol/L). As a result, the maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential is very fast. This intense influx of sodium is very brief because opening of the m gates upon depolarization is promptly followed by closure of the h gates and inactivation of these channels (Figure 14–3, right). This inactivation contributes to the early repolarization phase of the action potential (phase 1). In some cardiac myocytes, phase 1 is also due to a brief increase in\n\n\n\nChanges in serum potassium can have profound effects on electrical activity of the heart. An increase in serum potas-sium, or hyperkalemia, can depolarize the resting mem-brane potential due to changes in EK. If the depolarization is great enough, it can inactivate sodium channels, resulting in increased refractory period duration and slowed impulse propagation. Conversely, a decrease in serum potassium, or hypokalemia, can hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential. This can lead to an increase in pacemaker activity due to greater activation of pacemaker channels, especially in latent pacemakers (eg, Purkinje cells), which are more sensitive to changes in serum potassium than normal pacemaker cells. If one only considers what happens to the potassium electrochemical gradient, changes in serum potassium can also produce effects that appear somewhat paradoxical, especially as they relate to action potential duration. This is because changes in serum potassium also affect the potas-sium conductance (increased potassium increases the con-ductance, decreased potassium decreases the conductance), and this effect often predominates. As a result, hyperkalemiacan reduce action potential duration, and hypokalemiacan prolong action potential duration. This effect of potassium probably contributes to the observed increase in sensitivity to potassium channel-blocking antiarrhythmic agents (quini-dine or sotalol) during hypokalemia, resulting in accentuated action potential prolongation and a tendency to cause torsades de pointes arrhythmia. FIGURE 14–3 A schematic representation of Na+ channels cycling through different conformational states during the cardiac action potential. Transitions between resting, activated, and inactivated states are dependent on membrane potential and time. The activation gate is shown as m and the inactivation gate as h. Potentials typical for each state are shown under each channel schematic as a function of time. The dashed line indicates that part of the action potential during which most Na+ channels are completely or partially inactivated and unavailable for reactivation. potassium permeability due to the activity of channels generating transient outward currents. Although a small fraction of the sodium channels activated during the upstroke may actually remain open well into the later phases of the action potential, sustained depolarization during the plateau (phase 2) is due primarily to the activity of calcium channels. Because the equilibrium potential for calcium, like sodium, is very positive, these channels generate a depolarizing inward current. Cardiac calcium channels activate and inactivate in what appears to be a manner similar to sodium channels, but in the case of the most common type of calcium channel (the “L” type), the transitions occur more slowly and at more positive potentials. After activation, these channels eventually inactivate and the permeability to potassium begins to increase, leading to final repolarization (phase 3) of the action potential. Two types of potassium channels are particularly important in phase 3 repolarization. They generate what are referred to as the rapidly activating (IKr) and slowly activating (IKs) delayed rectifier potassium currents. Repolarization, especially late in phase 3, is also aided by the inward rectifying potassium channels that are responsible for the resting membrane potential. It is noteworthy that other delayed rectifier-type potassium currents also play important roles in repolarization of certain cardiac cell types. For example, the ultra-rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKur) is particularly important in repolarizing the atrial action potential. The resting membrane potential and repolarization of atrial myocytes are also affected by potassium channels that are gated by the parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Purkinje cells are similar to atrial and ventricular cells in that they generate an action potential with a fast upstroke due to the activity of sodium channels. However, unlike atrial and ventricular cells, the membrane potential during phase 4 exhibits spontaneous depolarization. This is due to the presence of pacemaker channels that generate an inward depolarizing pacemaker current. This is sometimes referred to as the “funny” current (If), because the channels involved have the unusual property of being activated by membrane hyperpolarization. Under some circumstances, Purkinje cells can act as pacemakers for the heart by spontaneously depolarizing and initiating an action potential that is then propagated throughout the ventricular myocardium. However, under normal conditions, the action potential in Purkinje cells is triggered by impulses that originate in the SA node and are conducted to these cells through the AV node. Pacemaking activity in the SA node is due to spontaneous depolarization during phase 4 of the action potential as well (Figure 14–1). This diastolic depolarization is mediated in part by the activity of pacemaker channels. It is also thought to be due to the net inward current generated by the sodium-calcium exchanger, which is activated by the spontaneous release of calcium from intracellular storage sites. Unlike the action potential in Purkinje cells, spontaneous depolarization in the SA node triggers the upstroke of an action potential that is primarily due to an increase in permeability to calcium, not sodium. Because the calcium channels involved open or activate slowly, the maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential in SA node cells is relatively slow. Repolarization occurs when the calcium channels subsequently close due to inactivation and delayed rectifier-type potassium channels open. A similar process is involved in generating action potentials in the AV node. Although the intrinsic rate of spontaneous diastolic depolarization in the AV node is typically faster than that of Purkinje cells, it is still slower than the rate of depolarization in the SA node. Therefore, action potentials in the AV node are normally triggered by impulses that originate in the SA node and are conducted to the AV node through the atria. It is important to recognize that action potential upstroke velocity is a key determinant of impulse conduction velocity. Because the action potential upstroke in AV node cells is mediated by calcium channels, which open or activate relatively slowly, impulse conduction through the AV node is slow. This contributes to the delay between atrial and ventricular contraction. Electrical activity in the SA node and AV node is significantly influenced by the autonomic nervous system (see Chapter 6). Sympathetic activation of β adrenoceptors speeds pacemaker activity in the SA node and impulse propagation through the AV node by enhancing pacemaker and calcium channel activity, respectively. Conversely, parasympathetic activation of muscarinic receptors slows pacemaker activity and conduction velocity by inhibiting the activity of these channels, as well as by increasing the potassium conductance by turning on acetylcholine-activated potassium channels. The Effect of Membrane Potential on Excitability\n\n\n\nA key factor in the pathophysiology of arrhythmias and the actions of antiarrhythmic agents is the relationship between the membrane potential and the effect it has on the ion channels responsible for excitability of the cell. During the plateau of atrial, ventricular, or Purkinje cell action potentials, most sodium channels are inactivated, rendering the cell refractory or inexcitable. Upon repolarization, recovery from inactivation takes place (in the terminology of Figure 14–3, the h gates reopen), making the channels available again for excitation. This is a timeand voltage-dependent process. The actual time required for enough sodium channels to recover from inactivation in order that a new propagated response can be generated is called the refractory period. Full recovery of excitability typically does not occur until action potential repolarization is complete. Thus, refractoriness or excitability can be affected by factors that alter either action potential duration or the resting membrane potential. This relationship can also be significantly impacted by certain classes of antiarrhythmic agents. One example is drugs that block sodium channels. They can reduce the extent and rate of recovery from inactivation (Figure 14–4). Changes in refractoriness caused by either altered recovery from inactivation or altered action potential duration can be important in the genesis or suppression of certain arrhythmias. A reduction in the number of available sodium channels can reduce excitability. In some cases, it may result in the cell being totally refractory or inexcitable. In other cases, there may be a reduction in peak sodium permeability. This can reduce the\n\n\n\nDrug Control Drug Control Channels available, percent of maximumRecovery time constant (ms) 100 0 100,000 10,000 1000 100 10 0\n\n\n\nFIGURE 14–4 Dependence of sodium channel function on the membrane potential preceding the stimulus. Left: The fraction of sodium channels available for opening in response to a stimulus is determined by the membrane potential immediately preceding the stimulus. The decrease in the fraction available when the resting potential is depolarized in the absence of a drug (control curve) results from the voltage-dependent closure of h gates in the channels. The curve labeled Drug illustrates the effect of a typical local anesthetic antiarrhythmic drug. Most sodium channels are inactivated during the plateau of the action potential. Right: The time constant for recovery from inactivation after repolarization also depends on the resting potential. In the absence of drug, recovery occurs in less than 10 ms at normal resting potentials (−85 to −95 mV). Depolarized cells recover more slowly (note logarithmic scale). In the presence of a sodium channel-blocking drug, the time constant of recovery is increased, but the increase is far greater at depolarized potentials than at more negative ones. maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential, which will in phase 3 of the action potential, or delayed afterdepolarizations turn reduce action potential conduction velocity.

As a increase in the QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Such an result, calcium channel blockers can decrease pacemaker activity in the SA node as well as conduction velocity in the AV node. Many factors can precipitate or exacerbate arrhythmias: ischemia, hypoxia, acidosis or alkalosis, electrolyte abnormalities, excessive catecholamine exposure, autonomic influences, drug toxicity (eg, digitalis or antiarrhythmic drugs), overstretching of cardiac fibers, and the presence of scarred or otherwise diseased tissue. However, all arrhythmias result from (1) disturbances in impulse formation and/or (2) disturbances in impulse conduction. Disturbances of Impulse Formation\n\n\n\nPacemaking activity is regulated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity (see above). Therefore, factors that antagonize or enhance these effects can alter normal impulse formation, producing either bradycardia or tachycardia. Genetic mutations have also been found to alter normal pacemaking activity. Under certain circumstances, abnormal activity can be generated by latent pacemakers, cells that show slow phase 4 depolarization even under normal conditions (eg, Purkinje cells). Such cells are\n\n\n\nEarly afterdepolarization (arises from the plateau) Delayed afterdepolarization (arises from the resting potential) Prolonged plateau 0 mV –70 0 mV –70 0.5 sec\n\n\n\nFIGURE 14–5 Two forms of abnormal activity, early (top) and particularly prone to accelerated pacemaker activity, especially under delayed afterdepolarizations (bottom). In both cases, abnormal conditions such as hypokalemia. Abnormalities in impulse formation depolarizations arise during or after a normally evoked action can also be the result of afterdepolarizations (Figure 14–5). These can potential. They are therefore often referred to as “triggered” automaticity; be either early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which occur during that is, they require a normal action potential for their initiation. It is now possible to define the molecular basis of several con-genital and acquired cardiac arrhythmias. The best example is the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsades de pointes (Figure 14–8), which is associated with prolongation of the QT interval (especially at the onset of the tachycardia), syncope, and sudden death. This represents prolongation of the action potential of at least some ventricular cells (Figure 14–1). The effect can, in theory, be attributed to either increased inward current (gain of function) or decreased outward current (loss of function) during the plateau of the action potential. Action potential prolongation is thought to generate early afterdepo-larizations (Figure 14–5) that then trigger torsades de pointes. Recent molecular genetic studies have identified up to 300 different mutations in at least eight ion channel genes that produce congenital long QT (LQT) syndrome (Table 14–1). Loss-of-function mutations in potassium channel genes (HERG, KCNE2, KCNQ1, KCNE1, and KCNJ2) result in decreased outward plateau current, while gain-of-function mutations in the sodium channel gene (SCN5A) or calcium channel gene (CACNA1c) cause increases in inward plateau current. The identification of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying various forms of the LQT syndromes now raises the possibility that specific therapies may be developed for individu-als with defined molecular abnormalities. Indeed, preliminary reports suggest that the sodium channel blocker mexiletine can correct the clinical manifestations of congenital LQT subtype 3, while β-blockers have been used to prevent arrhythmias trig-gered by sympathetic stimulation in patients with LQT subtype 1. The molecular basis of several other congenital cardiac arrhythmias associated with sudden death has also recently been identified. At least three forms of short QT syndrome have been identified that are linked to gain-of-function mutations in different potassium channel genes (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a disease that is characterized by stressor emotion-induced syncope, can be caused by mutations in at least two different genes (hRyR2 and CASQ2) of proteins expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum that control intracellular calcium homeostasis. Mutations in two different ion channel genes (HCN4 and SCN5A) have been linked to congenital forms of sick sinus syndrome. Several forms of Brugada syndrome, which is characterized by ventricular fibrillation associated with persistent ST-segment elevation, and progressive cardiac conduction disorder (PCCD), which is characterized by impaired conduction in the His-Purkinje system and right or left bundle block leading to complete AV block, have been linked to loss-of-function mutations in the sodium channel gene (SCN5A). At least one form of familial atrial fibrillation is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in a potassium channel gene (KCNQ1). effect can be caused by genetic mutations associated with congenital long QT (LQT) syndrome (see Box: Molecular & Genetic Basis of Cardiac Arrhythmias). A number of drugs (antiarrhythmic as well as non-antiarrhythmic agents) can produce “acquired” or drug-induced LQT syndrome, which is typically due to block of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channels. Many forms of LQT syndrome are exacerbated by other factors that prolong action potential duration, including hypokalemia and slow heart rates. DADs, on the other hand, often occur when there is an excess accumulation of intracellular calcium (see Chapter 13), especially at fast heart rates. They are thought to be responsible for arrhythmias associated with digitalis toxicity, excess catecholamine stimulation, and myocardial ischemia. Disturbances of Impulse Conduction\n\n\n\nThe most common form of conduction disturbance affects the AV node, causing various degrees of heart block. The result can be a simple slowing of impulse propagation through the AV node, which is reflected by an increase in the PR interval of the ECG. At the extreme, the result can be complete heart block, where no impulses are conducted from the atria to the ventricles. In this situation, ventricular activity is generated by a latent pacemaker, such as a Purkinje cell. Because the AV node is typically under the tonic influence of the parasympathetic nervous system, which slows conduction, AV block can sometimes be relieved by antimuscarinic agents like atropine. A serious form of conduction abnormality involves reentry (also known as “circus movement”). In this situation, one impulse reenters and excites areas of the heart more than once. The path of the reentering impulse may be confined to very small areas, such as within or near the AV node or where a Purkinje fiber makes contact with the ventricular wall (Figure 14–6), or it may involve large portions of the atria or ventricles. Some forms of reentry are strictly anatomically determined. For example, in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the reentry circuit consists of atrial tissue, the AV node, ventricular tissue, and an accessory AV connection (bundle of Kent, a bypass tract). Depending on how many round trips through the pathway a reentrant impulse makes before dying out, the arrhythmia may be manifest as one or a few extra beats or as a sustained tachycardia. Circulating impulses can also give off “daughter impulses” that can spread to the rest of the heart. In cases such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation, multiple reentry circuits may meander through the heart in apparently random paths, resulting in the loss of synchronized contraction. An example of how reentry can occur is illustrated in Figure 14–6. In this scenario, there are three key elements: (1) First is an obstacle (anatomic or physiologic) to homogeneous impulse conduction, thus establishing a circuit around which the reentrant wave front can propagate. (2) The second element is unidirectional block at some point in the circuit. That is, something has occurred such that an impulse reaching the site initially encounters refractory tissue.', 'The most common indication for pacemaker placement. T AB LE 2.1 -2.

","['347. ESOPHAgEAL VARICES Patients with variceal hemorrhage have poorer outcomes than patients with other sources of UGIB. Urgent endoscopy within 12 h is recommended in cirrhotics with UGIB, and if esophageal varices are present, endoscopic ligation is performed and an IV vasoactive medication (e.g., octreotide 50 μg bolus and 50 μg/h infusion) is given for 2–5 days. Combination endoscopic and medical therapy appears to be superior to either therapy alone in decreasing rebleeding. In patients with advanced liver disease (e.g., Child-Pugh class C with score 10–13), a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should be strongly considered within the first 1–2 days of hospitalization because randomized trials show significant decreases in rebleeding and mortality compared with standard endoscopic and medical therapy. Over the long term, treatment with nonselective beta blockers plus endoscopic ligation is recommended because the combination of endoscopic and medical therapy is more effective than either alone in reduction of recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding. In patients who have persistent or recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic and medical therapy, TIPS is recommended. Decompressive surgery (e.g., distal splenorenal shunt) may be considered instead of TIPS in patients with well-compensated cirrhosis. Portal hypertension is also responsible for bleeding from gastric varices, varices in the small and large intestine, and portal hypertensive gastropathy and enterocolopathy. Bleeding gastric varices due to cirrhosis are treated with endoscopic injection of tissue adhesive (e.g., n-butyl cyanoacrylate), if available; if not, TIPS is performed. HEMORRHAgIC ANd EROSIVE gASTROPATHY (“gASTRITIS”) Hemorrhagic and erosive gastropathy, often labeled gastritis, refers to endoscopically visualized subepithelial hemorrhages and erosions. These are mucosal lesions and do not cause major bleeding due to the absence of arteries and veins in the mucosa.', '365-3)\n\n\n\nOnce patients have had an acute bleed and have been managed successfully, attention should be paid to preventing recurrent bleeding. This usually requires repeated variceal band ligation until varices are obliterated. Beta blockade may be of adjunctive benefit in patients who are having recurrent variceal band ligation; however, once varices have been obliterated, the need for beta blockade is lessened. Despite successful variceal obliteration, many patients will still have portal hypertensive gastropathy from which bleeding can occur. Nonselective beta blockade may be helpful to prevent further bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy once varices have been obliterated. Portosystemic shunt surgery is less commonly performed with the advent of TIPS; nonetheless, this procedure should be considered for patients with good hepatic synthetic function who could benefit by having portal decompressive surgery. Congestive splenomegaly is common in patients with portal hypertension. Clinical features include the presence of an enlarged spleen on physical examination and the development of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in patients who have cirrhosis. Some patients will have fairly significant left-sided and left upper quadrant abdominal pain related to an enlarged and engorged spleen. Splenomegaly itself usually requires no specific treatment, although splenectomy can be successfully performed under very special circumstances. Hypersplenism with the development of thrombocytopenia is a common feature of patients with cirrhosis and is usually the first indication of portal hypertension.

Each bleeding event carries a 30% mortality rate and accounts for a third of all deaths related to cirrhosis. Only 50% of bleeding events cease spontaneously, so treatment must be expedient. The initial medical treatment is with vasopressin and octreotide. The initial intervention is endoscopy with sclerotherapy and band ligation of bleeding varices. If those initial attempts fail, more aggressive treatment is necessary with a balloon tamponade (using a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube) and with emergent TIPS placement. The last line of treatment is emergency surgery to place a portosystemic shunt, transect the esophagus, or devascularize the gastroesoph-ageal junction (Sugiura procedure).

","['Among 144 such patients, more than 40 possible etiologies were identified by H.P.', 'Cyanosis and clubbing of the digits occur in some patients with advanced disease. Antinuclear antibodies and anti-immunoglobulin antibodies (rheumatoid factors) are identified in some patients, even in the absence 1710 of a defined CTD. A raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is a nonspecific finding common to ILDs. Elevation of the serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme is common in ILDs, especially sarcoidosis. Serum precipitins confirm exposure when hypersensitivity pneumonitis is suspected, although they are not diagnostic of the process. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic or anti-basement membrane antibodies are useful if vasculitis is suspected. The electrocardiogram is usually normal unless pulmonary hypertension is present; then it demonstrates right-axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy, or right atrial enlargement or hypertrophy. Echocardiography also reveals right ventricular dilation and/or hypertrophy in the presence of pulmonary hypertension. CHEST IMAGING STUDIES Chest X-Ray ILD may be first suspected on the basis of an abnormal chest radiograph, which most commonly reveals a bibasilar reticular pattern. A nodular or mixed pattern of alveolar filling and increased reticular markings also may be present. Subgroups of ILDs exhibit nodular opacities with a predilection for the upper lung zones (sarcoidosis, PLCH, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, silicosis, berylliosis, RA [necrobiotic nodular form], ankylosing spondylitis). The chest x-ray correlates poorly with the clinical or histopathologic stage of the disease. The radiographic finding of honeycombing correlates with pathologic findings of small cystic spaces and progressive fibrosis; when present, it portends a poor prognosis. In most cases, the chest radiograph is nonspecific and usually does not allow a specific diagnosis. Computed Tomography HRCT is superior to the plain chest x-ray for early detection and confirmation of suspected ILD (Fig. 315-2). In addition, HRCT allows better assessment of the extent and distribution of disease, and it is especially useful in the investigation of patients with a normal chest radiograph. Coexisting disease is often best recognized on HRCT scanning, e.g., mediastinal adenopathy, carcinoma, or emphysema. In the appropriate clinical setting, HRCT may be sufficiently characteristic to preclude the need for lung biopsy in IPF, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, asbestosis, lymphangitic carcinoma, and PLCH. When a lung biopsy is required, HRCT scanning is useful for determining the most appropriate area from which biopsy samples should be taken. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTING Spirometry and Lung Volumes Measurement of lung function is important in assessing the extent of pulmonary involvement in patients with ILD. Most forms of ILD produce a restrictive defect with reduced total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity, and residual volume\n\n\n\nFIGURE 315-2 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Interstitial nephritis may lead to white blood cell casts. The urine sediment findings overlap somewhat in glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis, and a diagnosis is not always possible on the basis of the urine sediment alone. Urine eosinophils have a limited role in differential diagnosis; they can be seen in interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, cystitis, atheroembolic disease, or glomerulonephritis. Crystalluria may be important diagnostically. The finding of oxalate crystals in AKI should prompt an evaluation for ethylene glycol toxicity. Abundant uric acid crystals may be seen in the tumor lysis syndrome. Certain forms of AKI are associated with characteristic patterns in the rise and fall of SCr. Prerenal azotemia typically leads to modest rises in SCr that return to baseline with improvement in hemodynamic status.

Some conditions may require the involvement of a maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist, geneticist, pediatrician, anesthesiologist, or other medical specialist in the evaluation, counseling, and care of the woman and her fetus. hese are traditionally scheduled at 4-week intervals until 28 weeks, then every 2 weeks until 36 weeks, and weekly thereafter. Women with complicated pregnancies-for example, with twins or diabetes-often require return visits at 1-to 2-week intervals (Luke, 2003; Power, 2013). In 1986, the Department of Health and Human Services convened an expert panel to review the content of prenatal care. his report was subsequently reevaluated and revised in 2005 (Gregory, 2006). he panel recommended, among other things, early and continuing risk assessment that is patient speciic. It also endorsed lexibility in clinical visit spacing; health promotion and education, including preconceptional care; medical and psychosocial interventions; standardized documentation; and expanded prenatal care objectives-to include family health up to 1 year after birth. he World Health Organization conducted a multicenter randomized trial with almost 25,000 women comparing routine prenatal care with an experimental model designed to minimize visits (Villar, 2001). In the new model, women were seen once in the irst trimester and screened for certain risks. hose without anticipated complications-80 percent of those screened-were seen again at 26, 32, and 38 weeks. Compared with routine prenatal care, which required a median of eight visits, the new model required a median of only ive. No disadvantages were attributed to the regimen with fewer visits, and these indings were consistent with other randomized trials (Clement, 1999; McDuie, 1996). At each return visit, the well-being of mother and fetus are assessed (see Table 9-1). Fetal heart rate, growth, and activity and amnionic fluid volume are evaluated. Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks\' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435). Between 20 and 34 weeks\' gestation, the height of the uterine fundus measured in centimeters correlates closely with gestational age in weeks Gimenez, 1983). his measurement is used to monitor fetal growth and amnionic fluid volume. It is measured along the abdominal wall from the top of the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus. Importantly, the bladder must be emptied before fundal measurement (Worthen, 1980). Obesity or the presence of uterine masses such as leiomyomas may also limit fundal height accuracy. Moreover, using fundal height alone, fetal-growth restriction may be undiagnosed in up to a third of cases (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015b; Haragan, 2015). Instruments incorporating Doppler ultrasound are often used to easily detect fetal heart action, and in the absence of maternal obesity, heart sounds are almost always detectable by 10 weeks with such instruments (Chap. 10, p. 213). he fetal heart rate ranges from 11e0 to 160 beats per minute and is typically heard as a double sound. Using a standard nonampliied stethoscope, the fetal heart is audible by 20 weeks in 80 percent of women, and by 22 weeks, heart sounds are expected to be heard in all (Herbert, 1987). Because the fetus moves freely in amni onic fluid, the site on the maternal abdomen where fetal heart sounds can be heard best will vary. Additionally, with ultrasonic auscultation, one may hear the unic soule, which is a sharp, whistling sound that is syn chronous with the fetal pulse. It is caused by the rush of blood through the umbilical arteries and may not be heard consistently. In contrast, the uterine soule is a soft, blowing sound that is synchronous with the maternal pulse. It is produced by the pas sage of blood through the dilated uterine vessels and is heard most distinctly near the lower portion of the uterus. Sonography provides invaluable information regarding fetal anatomy, growth, and well-being, and most women in the United States have at least one prenatal sonographic examination during pregnancy (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016h). Continuing trends suggest that the number of these examinations performed per pregnancy is increasing. Siddique and associates (2009) reported that the average number rose from 1.5 in 1995 through 1997 to 2.7 almost 10 years later. his trend was noted in both high-and low-risk pregnancies.', 'Close surveillance is necessary. Covert bacteriuria is treated, and if it is recurrent, suppressive therapy is given for the remainder of the pregnancy. Serial hepatic enzyme concentrations and blood counts are monitored for toxic efects of azathioprine and cyclosporine. Some recommend measurement of serum cyclo sporine levels. Gestational diabetes is more common if corti costeroids are taken, and overt diabetes must be excluded with tation. Surveillance for opportunistic infections from herpesvi rus, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis is important because these infections are common. Some recommend surveillance for BK virus, however, treatment is problematic Gosephson, 2011). Renal function is monitored, and the GFR usually increases 20 to 25 percent. If a signiicant rise in the serum creatinine level is detected, then its cause must be determined. Possibilities include acute rejection, cyclosporine toxicity, preeclampsia, infection, and urinary tract obstruction. Evidence of pyelonephritis or graft rejection should prompt aggressive management. Imaging studies and kidney biopsy may be indicated. The woman is carefully monitored for development or worsening of underlying hypertension, and especially superimposed preeclampsia. Management of hypertension during pregnancy is the same as for patients without a transplant. Because of increased incidences of fetal-growth restriction and preterm delivery, vigilant fetal surveillance is indicated (Chaps. 42, p.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Pregnancy complications that increase the risk of a poor outcome can be secondary to maternal or fetal causes or both.

"A 70-year-old women presents to her primary care physician with sudden episodes of dizziness that resolve in certain positions. On further questioning she describes a false sense of motion with occasional spinning sensation consistent with vertigo. She denies any recent illnesses or hearing loss aside from presbycusis. Her vital signs are normal. During the physical exam the the patient reports an episode of vertigo after transitioning from sitting to supine and horizontal nystagmus is concurrently noted. What is the mostly likely diagnosis?
A:Vestibular migraine
B:Meniere's disease
C:Labyrinthitis
D:Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
E:Vestibular neuritis
","['The patient frequently gives a history of an antecedent upper respiratory infection of nonspecific type, but it is not clear whether this is requisite for the diagnosis. Usually, the onset of vertigo is fairly abrupt, although some patients describe a prodromal period of several hours or days in which they felt “top-heavy” or “off balance.” Persistence of the symptoms for a day or more differentiates the process from Ménière disease. The vertigo is severe as a rule and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and the need to remain immobile. Nystagmus (quick component) and a sense of body motion are to the opposite side, whereas falling and past pointing are to the side of the affected labyrinth. In some patients, the caloric responses are abnormal bilaterally, and in some, the vertigo may recur, affecting the same or the other ear. Auditory function is normal. Examination discloses vestibular paresis on one side, that is, an absent or diminished response to caloric stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canal. If the patient will tolerate small head movements, the previously described rapid-head-impulse test of Halmagyi and Cremer is one of the best means of demonstrating absent function of one lateral semicircular canal. Although the symptoms can be quite disabling for a short period, vestibular neuritis is an ostensibly benign disorder. The severe vertigo and associated symptoms subside in a matter of several days, but lesser degrees of these symptoms, made worse by rapid movements of the head, may persist for months. The caloric responses are gradually restored to normal as well.', 'The history should focus closely on other features, including whether this is the first attack, the duration of this and any prior episodes, provoking factors, and accompanying symptoms. Dizziness can be divided into episodes that last for seconds, minutes, hours, or days. Common causes of brief dizziness (seconds) include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and orthostatic hypotension, both of which typically are provoked by changes in head and body position. Attacks of vestibular migraine and Ménière’s disease often last hours. When episodes are of intermediate duration (minutes), transient ischemic attacks of the posterior circulation should be considered, although migraine and a number of other causes are also possible. Symptoms that accompany vertigo may be helpful in distinguishing peripheral vestibular lesions from central causes. Unilateral hearing loss and other aural symptoms (ear pain, pressure, fullness) typically point to a peripheral cause. Because the auditory pathways quickly become bilateral upon entering the brainstem, central lesions are unlikely to cause unilateral hearing loss, unless the lesion lies near the root entry zone of the auditory nerve. Symptoms such as double vision, numbness, and limb ataxia suggest a brainstem or cerebellar lesion. Because dizziness and imbalance can be a manifestation of a variety of neurologic disorders, the neurologic examination is important in the evaluation of these patients. Particular focus should be given to assessment of eye movements, vestibular function, and hearing. The range of eye movements and whether they are equal in each eye should be observed. Peripheral eye movement disorders (e.g., cranial neuropathies, eye muscle weakness) are usually disconjugate (different in the two eyes). One should check pursuit (the ability to follow a smoothly moving target) and saccades (the ability to look back and forth accurately between two targets). Poor pursuit or inaccurate (dysmetric) saccades usually indicates central pathology, often involving the cerebellum. Finally, one should look for spon taneous nystagmus, an involuntary back-and-forth movement of the eyes. Nystagmus is most often of the jerk type, in which a slow drift (slow phase) in one direction alternates with a rapid saccadic movement (quick phase or fast phase) in the opposite direction that resets the position of the eyes in the orbits. Except in the case of acute vestibulopathy (e.g., vestibular neuritis), if primary position nystagmus is easily seen in the light, it is probably due to a central cause. Two forms of nystagmus that are characteristic of lesions of the cerebellar pathways are vertical nystagmus with downward changes direction with gaze (gaze-evoked nystagmus). By contrast, tagmus. Use of Frenzel eyeglasses (self-illuminated goggles with convex lenses that blur the patient’s vision but allow the examiner to see the eyes greatly magnified) can aid in the detection of peripheral vestibular nystagmus, because they reduce the patient’s ability to use visual fixation to suppress nystagmus. Table 28-1 outlines key find ings that help distinguish peripheral from central causes of vertigo. The most useful bedside test of peripheral vestibular function is the head impulse test, in which the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) is assessed with small-amplitude (~20 degrees) rapid head rotations. While the patient fixates on a target, the head is rotated to the left or right. If the VOR is deficient, the rotation is followed by a catch up saccade in the opposite direction (e.g., a leftward saccade after a rightward rotation). The head impulse test can identify both uni lateral (catch-up saccades after rotations toward the weak side) and in both directions). All patients with episodic dizziness, especially if provoked by positional change, should be tested with the Dix-Hallpike maneu ver.

Posterior canal BPPV can be diagnosed confidently if transient upbeating-torsional nystagmus is seen. If no nystagmus is observed after 15–20 s, the patient is raised to the sitting position, and the procedure is repeated with the head turned to the other side.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:\n\n\n\nWhen a patient presents with dizziness, the first step is to delineate more precisely the nature of the symptom. In the case of vestibular disorders, the physical symptoms depend on whether the lesion is unilateral or bilateral, and whether it is acute or chronic and progressive. Vertigo, an illusion of self or environmental motion, implies asymmetry of vestibular inputs from the two labyrinths or in their central pathways that is usually acute. Symmetric bilateral vestibular hypofunction causes imbalance but no vertigo. Because of the ambiguity in patients’ descriptions of their symptoms, diagnosis based simply on symptom characteristics is typically unreliable. The history should focus closely on other features, including whether this is the first attack, the duration of this and any prior episodes, provoking factors, and accompanying symptoms.', 'When the patient’s symptoms are mild or poorly described, small items of the history—a desire to keep still and a disinclination to stoop or walk during an attack, a tendency to list to one side, an aggravation of symptoms by turning over in bed or closing his eyes, a sense of imbalance when making a quick turn on foot or in a car, and a preference for one position of the body or head—help to identify them as vertigo. At the other end of the scale are attacks of such abruptness and severity as to virtually throw the patient to the ground. Independently occurring vertiginous attacks of the usual variety mark these falling episodes as part of Ménière disease (see further on). On the other hand, a dizzy sensation that is not made worse markedly by vigorous shaking of the head is unlikely to relate to vertigo, particularly that type due to peripheral vestibular disease.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0

A:Ovarian follicular cells
B:Adipocytes
C:Pituitary gonadotropic cells
D:Ovarian theca cells
E:Pituitary lactotrophs
","['BASIC PRINCIPLES\n\n\n\nA. The functional unit of the ovary is the follicle. B. A follicle consists of an oocyte surrounded by granulosa and theca cells (Fig. 13.llA) 1. LH acts on theca cells to induce androgen production. 2. FSH stimulates granulosa cells to convert androgen to estradiol (drives the proliferative phase of the endometrial cycle). 3. Estradiol surge induces an LH surge, which leads to ovulation (marking the beginning of the secretory phase of the endometrial cycle). C. After ovulation, the residual follicle becomes a corpus luteum (Fig. 13.llB), which primarily secretes progesterone (drives the secretory phase which prepares the endometrium for a possible pregnancy). 1. Hemorrhage into a corpus luteum can result in a hemorrhagic corpus luteal cyst, especially during early pregnancy. D. Degeneration of follicles results in follicular cysts. Small numbers of follicular cysts are common in women and have no clinical significance. II. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN DISEASE (PCOD)\n\n\n\nA. Multiple ovarian follicular cysts due to hormone imbalance 1. Affects roughly 5% of women of reproductive age\n\n\n\nB. Characterized by increased LH and low FSH (LH:FSH > 2) 1. Increased LH induces excess androgen production (from theca cells) resulting in hirsutism (excess hair in a male distribution). 2. Androgen is converted to estrone in adipose tissue. i. Estrone feedback decreases FSH resulting in cystic degeneration of follicles. ii. High levels of circulating estrone increase risk for endometrial carcinoma. C. Classic presentation is an obese young woman with infertility, oligomenorrhea, and hirsutism; some patients have insulin resistance and may develop type 2 diabetes mellitus 10-15 years later. Fig. 13.10 Uterine leiomyomas. (Courtesy of Fig. 13.11 Ovarian follicle. A, Normal. B, Corpus luteum. (B, Courtesy of Ed Uthman, MD) Jamie Steinmetz, MD)\n\n\n\nI.', 'Hirsutism David A. Ehrmann Hirsutism, which is defined as androgen-dependent excessive male-pattern hair growth, affects approximately 10% of women. Hirsutism is most often idiopathic or the consequence of androgen excess associ-ated with the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Less frequently, it 68 may result from adrenal androgen overproduction as occurs in non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) (Table 68-1). Rarely, it is a sign of a serious underlying condition. Cutaneous manifestations commonly associated with hirsutism include acne and male-pattern balding (androgenic alopecia). Virilization refers to a condition in which androgen levels are sufficiently high to cause additional signs and symptoms, such as deepening of the voice, breast atrophy,\n\n\n\nSyndromes of extreme insulin resistance (e.g., lipodystrophy)\n\n\n\nThecoma of pregnancy increased muscle bulk, clitoromegaly, and increased libido; virilization is an ominous sign that suggests the possibility of an ovarian or adrenal neoplasm. Hair can be categorized as either vellus (fine, soft, and not pigmented) or terminal (long, coarse, and pigmented). The number of hair follicles does not change over an individual’s lifetime, but the follicle size and type of hair can change in response to numerous factors, particularly androgens. Androgens are necessary for terminal hair and sebaceous gland development and mediate differentiation of pilosebaceous units (PSUs) into either a terminal hair follicle or a sebaceous gland. In the former case, androgens transform the vellus hair into a terminal hair; in the latter case, the sebaceous component proliferates and the hair remains vellus. There are three phases in the cycle of hair growth: (1) anagen (growth phase), (2) catagen (involution phase), and (3) telogen (rest phase). Depending on the body site, hormonal regulation may play an important role in the hair growth cycle. For example, the eyebrows, eyelashes, and vellus hairs are androgen-insensitive, whereas the axillary and pubic areas are sensitive to low levels of androgens. Hair growth on the face, chest, upper abdomen, and back requires higher levels of androgens and is therefore more characteristic of the pattern typically seen in men. Androgen excess in women leads to increased hair growth in most androgen-sensitive sites except in the scalp region, where hair loss occurs because androgens cause scalp hairs to spend less time in the anagen phase. Although androgen excess underlies most cases of hirsutism, there is only a modest correlation between androgen levels and the quantity of hair growth. This is due to the fact that hair growth from the follicle also 332 depends on local growth factors, and there is variability in end organ (PSU) sensitivity. Genetic factors and ethnic background also influence hair growth. In general, dark-haired individuals tend to be more hirsute than blond or fair individuals. Asians and Native Americans have relatively sparse hair in regions sensitive to high androgen levels, whereas people of Mediterranean descent are more hirsute. Historic elements relevant to the assessment of hirsutism include the age at onset and rate of progression of hair growth and associated symptoms or signs (e.g., acne). Depending on the cause, excess hair growth typically is first noted during the second and third decades of life. The growth is usually slow but progressive. Sudden development and rapid progression of hirsutism suggest the possibility of an androgen-secreting neoplasm, in which case virilization also may be present. The age at onset of menstrual cycles (menarche) and the pattern of the menstrual cycle should be ascertained; irregular cycles from the time of menarche onward are more likely to result from ovarian rather than adrenal androgen excess. Associated symptoms such as galactorrhea should prompt evaluation for hyperprolactinemia (Chap. 403) and possibly hypothyroidism (Chap.']","['1', '""Increased LH induces excess androgen production (from theca cells) resulting in hirsutism (excess hair in a male distribution).""\n2', '""Androgens are necessary for terminal hair and sebaceous gland development and mediate differentiation of pilosebaceous units (PSUs) into either a terminal hair follicle or a sebaceous gland.""\n3', '""Hair growth on the face, chest, upper abdomen, and back requires higher levels of androgens and is therefore more characteristic of the pattern typically seen in men.""']",0.05970149253731343,"['manifestations include ovarian cysts that secrete sex steroids and cause precocious puberty, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, café-au-lait skin pigmentation, growth hormone–secreting pituitary adenomas, and hypersecreting autonomous thyroid nodules (Chap. 412).', 'Hirsutism = male hair pattern.\n\n\n\nVirilization = frontal balding, muscularity, clitoromegaly, and deepening of the voice.\n\n\n\nDefeminization = ↓ breast size; loss of feminine adipose tissue.\n\n\n\nThe most severe form of PCOS is HAIR-AN syndrome: HyperAndrogenism, Insulin Resistance, and Acanthosis Nigricans.\n\n\n\n■↑ androgens (testosterone > 2 ng; DHEAS > 7 μg/mL): Rule out adrenal or ovarian neoplasm. ■↑ serum testosterone: Suspect an ovarian tumor. ■↑ DHEAS: Suspect an adrenal source (adrenal tumor, Cushing’s syn drome, CAH). ■↑ 17-OH progesterone levels (either basally or in response to ACTH stimulation).\n\n\n\n■Table 2.12-5 outlines the differential diagnosis of hyperandrogenism.\n\n\n\nGlucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone).

This release causes intracellular [Ca++] to rise, which in turn promotes actin-myosin interaction and contraction. The time course for the increase in intracellular [Ca++] in relation to the action potential and development of force is shown in\n\n\n\nFig. 12.8 . The action potential is extremely short-lived (≈5 msec). The elevation in intracellular [Ca++] begins slightly after the action potential and peaks at approximately 20 msec. This increase in intracellular [Ca++] initiates a contraction called a twitch. The mechanism underlying the elevation in intracellular [Ca++] involves an interaction between protein in the T tubule and the adjacent terminal cisternae of the SR. As previously described (see\n\n\n\nFig. 12.3 ), the T tubule represents an invagination of the sarcolemma that extends into the muscle fiber and forms a close association with two terminal cisternae of the SR. The association of a T tubule with two opposing terminal cisternae is called a triad. Although there is a gap (≈15 nm in width) between the T tubule and the terminal cisternae, proteins bridge this gap. On the basis of their appearance on electron micrographs, these bridging proteins are called feet (\n\n\n\nFig. 12.9 ). These feet are the Ca++ release channels in the membrane of the terminal cisternae that are responsible for the elevation in intracellular [Ca++] in response to the action potential. Because this channel binds the drug ryanodine, it is commonly called the ryanodine receptor (RYR). RYR is a large protein (≈500 kDa) that exists as a homotetramer. Only a small portion of the RYR molecule is actually embedded in the SR membrane. Most of the RYR molecule appears to be in the myoplasm and spans the gap between the terminal cisternae and the T tubule (\n\n\n\nFig. 12.10\n\n\n\nAt the T tubule membrane, the RYR is thought to interact with a protein called the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR). DHPR is an L-type voltage-gated Ca++ channel with five subunits. One of these subunits binds the dihydropyridine class of channel-blocking drugs and appears to be crucial for the ability of the action potential in the T tubule to induce release of Ca++ from the SR. However, influx of Ca++ into the cell through the DHPR is not needed for the initiation of Ca++ release from the SR. In fact, skeletal muscle is able to contract in the absence of extracellular Ca++ or with a mutated DHPR that does not conduct Ca++ . Instead, release of Ca++ from the terminal cisternae of the SR is thought to result from a conformational change in the DHPR as the action potential passes down the T tubule, and this conformational change in the DHPR, by means of a protein-protein interaction, opens the RYR and releases Ca++ into the myoplasm. Structural analysis, including the use of freeze-fracture techniques, provides evidence for a close physical association of DHPR and RYR (see\n\n\n\nFig. 12.9 ). DHPR in the T tubule membrane appears to reside directly opposite the four corners of the underlying homotetrameric RYR channel in the SR membrane. Studies have shown that the SH3-cysteine rich domain 3 protein Stac3 is also critical for coupling of the DHPR to the RYR during excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle SR. Stac3 is not present in cardiac muscle, which relies on Ca++ influx through the sarcolemma to initiate Ca++ release from the RYR instead of the direct coupling of the DHPR and the RYR in skeletal muscle. Other proteins that reside near the RYR include calsequestrin, triadin, and junctin (see\n\n\n\nFig. 12.10 ). Calsequestrin is a low-affinity Ca++-binding protein that is present in the lumen of the terminal cisternae. It allows Ca++ to be “stored” at high concentration and thereby establishes a favorable concentration gradient that facilitates the efflux of Ca++ from the SR into the myoplasm when the RYR opens. Triadin and junctin are in the terminal cisternae membrane and bind both RYR and calsequestrin; they could anchor calsequestrin near the RYR and thereby increase Ca++ buffering capacity at the site of Ca++ release. Histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is another low-affinity Ca++-binding protein in the SR lumen, although it is less abundant than calsequestrin. It appears to bind triadin in a Ca++-dependent manner, which raises the possibility that it has a role more important than serving simply as a Ca++ buffer. There is also evidence for the presence of store-operated Ca entry (SOCE) in skeletal muscle (e.g., via the Orai/Stim1 complex) during tetany. Inhibition of Ca influx did not affect excitation-contraction coupling but did reduce maximal tetanic tension at high rates of electrical stimulation, which suggests that there may be some extrusion of intracellular Ca during tetany, which is compensated by Ca influx to maintain maximal tetanic tension. •Fig.', 'Action potential potential Sarcolemma b.

Uptake of Ca++ into the SR is due to the action of a Ca++ pump (i.e., Ca++-ATPase). This pump is not unique to skeletal muscle; it is found in all cells in association with the endoplasmic reticulum. Accordingly, it is named SERCA, which stands for sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. SERCA is the most abundant protein in the SR of skeletal muscle, and it is distributed throughout the longitudinal tubules and the terminal cisternae as well. It transports two molecules of Ca++ into its lumen for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. Thus the Ca++ transient seen during a twitch contraction (see\n\n\n\nFig. 12.8 ) reflects release of Ca++ from the terminal cisternae via the RYR and reuptake primarily into the longitudinal portion of the SR by SERCA. The low-affinity Ca++-binding protein sarcalumenin is present throughout the longitudinal tubules of the SR and nonjunctional regions of the terminal cisternae and is thought to be involved in the transfer of Ca++ from sites of Ca++ uptake in the longitudinal tubules to sites of Ca++ release in the terminal cisternae. Results of studies suggest that sarcalumenin increases Ca++ uptake by SERCA, at least in part by buffering luminal\n\n\n\nCa++ near the pump. The endogenous micropeptides phospholamban, sarcolipin, and myoregulin have been shown to regulate the activity of SERCA by decreasing the Ca sensitivity of Ca uptake (\n\n\n\nFig. 12.11 ). Protein kinase A–dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban in slow-twitch skeletal muscle has been reported to increase Ca transport in the SR, similar to the effect of phospholamban phosphorylation in the heart. Phospholamban and sarcolipin are present in slow-twitch muscle, whereas myoregulin is present in both fastand slow-twitch muscle. *During the transport of Ca++ , SERCA exchanges two Ca++ ions for two H+ ions (i.e., H+ is pumped out of the SR). •Fig.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['The cytoplasm (sarcoplasm) of the cell is abundant, and it contains myofibrils and various organelles such as mitochondria and ribosomes.

MANAGING OTHER COMPLICATIONS OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Medication Dose Adjustment Although the loading dose of most drugs is not affected by CKD because no renal elimination is used in the calculation, the maintenance doses of many drugs will need to be adjusted. For those agents in which >70% excretion is by a nonrenal route, such as hepatic elimination, dose adjustment may not be needed. Some drugs that should be avoided include metformin, meperidine, and oral hypoglycemics that are eliminated by the kidney. NSAIDs should be avoided because of the risk of further worsening of kidney function. Many antibiotics, antihypertensives, and antiarrhythmics may require a reduction in dosage or change in the dose interval. Several online Web-based databases for dose adjustment of medications according to stage of CKD or estimated GFR are available (e.g., http://www.globalrph.com/renaldosing2.htm). Nephrotoxic radiocontrast agents and gadolinium should be avoided or used according to strict guidelines when medically necessary as described above. PREPARATION FOR RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY (See also Chap. 337)\n\n\n\nTemporary relief of symptoms and signs of impending uremia, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lassitude, and pruritus, may sometimes be achieved with protein restriction. However, this carries a significant risk of malnutrition, and thus plans for more long-term management should be in place. Maintenance dialysis and kidney transplantation have extended the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients with CKD worldwide. Clear indications for initiation of renal replacement therapy for patients with CKD include uremic pericarditis, encephalopathy, intractable muscle cramping, anorexia, and nausea not attributable to reversible causes such as peptic ulcer disease, evidence of malnutrition, and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, principally hyperkalemia or ECFV overload, that are refractory to other measures. Recommendations for the Optimal Time for Initiation of Renal Replacement 1821\n\n\n\nTherapy Because of the individual variability in the severity of uremic symptoms and renal function, it is ill-advised to assign an arbitrary urea nitrogen or creatinine level to the need to start dialysis. Moreover, patients may become accustomed to chronic uremia and deny symptoms, only to find that they feel better with dialysis and realize in retrospect how poorly they were feeling before its initiation. Previous studies suggested that starting dialysis before the onset of severe symptoms and signs of uremia was associated with prolongation of survival. This led to the concept of “healthy” start and is congruent with the philosophy that it is better to keep patients feeling well all along rather than allowing them to become ill with uremia before trying to return them to better health with dialysis or transplantation. Although recent studies have not confirmed an association of early-start dialysis with improved patient survival, there may be merit in this approach for some patients. On a practical level, advanced preparation may help to avoid problems with the dialysis process itself (e.g., a poorly functioning fistula for hemodialysis or malfunctioning peritoneal dialysis catheter) and, thus, preempt the morbidity associated with resorting to the insertion of temporary hemodialysis access with its attendant risks of sepsis, bleeding, thrombosis, and association with accelerated mortality. Patient Education Social, psychological, and physical preparation for the transition to renal replacement therapy and the choice of the optimal initial modality are best accomplished with a gradual approach involving a multidisciplinary team. Along with conservative measures discussed in the sections above, it is important to prepare patients with an intensive educational program, explaining the likelihood and timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy and the various forms of therapy available, and the option of nondialytic maximum conservative care. The more knowledgeable that patients are about hemodialysis (both in-center and home-based), peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation, the easier and more appropriate will be their decisions. Patients who are provided with educational programs are more likely to choose home-based dialysis therapy. This approach is of societal benefit because home-based therapy is less expensive and is associated with improved quality of life. The educational programs should be commenced no later than stage 4 CKD so that the patient has sufficient time and cognitive function to learn the important concepts, make informed choices, and implement preparatory measures for renal replacement therapy. Exploration of social support is also important. In those who may perform home dialysis or undergo preemptive renal transplantation, early education of family members for selection and preparation of a home dialysis helper or a biologically or emotionally related potential living kidney donor should occur long before the onset of symptomatic renal failure. Kidney transplantation (Chap. 337) offers the best potential for complete rehabilitation, because dialysis replaces only a small fraction of the kidneys’ filtration function and none of the other renal functions, including endocrine and anti-inflammatory effects. Generally, kidney transplantation follows a period of dialysis treatment, although preemptive kidney transplantation (usually from a living donor) can be carried out if it is certain that the renal failure is irreversible. In contrast to the natural decline and successful eradication of many devastating infectious diseases, there is rapid growth in the prevalence of metabolic and vascular disease in developing countries. Diabetes mellitus is becoming increasingly prevalent in these countries, perhaps due in part to change in dietary habits, diminished physical activity, and weight gain. Therefore, it follows that there will be a proportionate increase in vascular and renal disease. Health care agencies must plan for improved screening for early detection, prevention, and treatment plans in these nations and must start considering options for improved availability of renal replacement therapies. 1822 part 13 Dialysis in the treatment of renal Failure Kathleen D. Liu, Glenn M. Chertow Dialysis may be required for the treatment of either acute or chronic kidney disease. The use of continuous renal replacement therapies 336 (CRRTs) and slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) is specific to the management of acute renal failure and is discussed in Chap. 334. These modalities are performed continuously (CRRT) or over 6–12 h per session (SLED), in contrast to the 3–4 h of an intermittent hemodialysis session. Advantages and disadvantages of CRRT and SLED are discussed in Chap. 334. Peritoneal dialysis is rarely used in developed countries for the treatment of acute renal failure because of the increased risk of infection and (as will be discussed in more detail below) less efficient clearance per unit of time. The focus of this chapter will be on the use of peritoneal and hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). With the widespread availability of dialysis, the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients with ESRD have been prolonged. In the United States alone, there are now approximately 615,000 patients with ESRD, the vast majority of whom require dialysis. The incidence rate for ESRD is 357 cases per million population per year. The incidence of ESRD is disproportionately higher in African Americans (940 per million population per year) as compared with white Americans (280 per million population per year). In the United States, the leading cause of ESRD is diabetes mellitus, currently accounting for nearly 45% of newly diagnosed cases of ESRD. Approximately 30% of patients have ESRD that has been attributed to hypertension, although it is unclear whether in these cases hypertension is the cause or a consequence of vascular disease or other unknown causes of kidney failure. Other prevalent causes of ESRD include glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and obstructive uropathy. Globally, mortality rates for patients with ESRD are lowest in\n\n\n\nEurope and Japan but very high in the developing world because of the limited availability of dialysis. In the United States, the mortality rate of patients on dialysis has decreased slightly but remains extremely high, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 35–40%. Deaths are due mainly to cardiovascular diseases and infections (approximately 40 and 10% of deaths, respectively). Older age, male sex, nonblack race, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and underlying heart disease are important predictors of death. Commonly accepted criteria for initiating patients on maintenance dialysis include the presence of uremic symptoms, the presence of hyperkalemia unresponsive to conservative measures, persistent extracellular volume expansion despite diuretic therapy, acidosis refractory to medical therapy, a bleeding diathesis, and a creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 10 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (see Chap. 335 for estimating equations). Timely referral to a nephrologist for advanced planning and creation of a dialysis access, education about ESRD treatment options, and management of the complications of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), including hypertension, anemia, acidosis, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, are advisable. Recent data have suggested that a sizable fraction of ESRD cases result following episodes of acute renal failure, particularly among persons with underlying CKD. Furthermore, there is no benefit to initiating dialysis preemptively at a GFR of 10–14 mL/min per 1.73 m2 compared to initiating dialysis for symptoms of uremia. In ESRD, treatment options include hemodialysis (in center or at home); peritoneal dialysis, as either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD); or transplantation (Chap. 337). Although there are significant geographic variations and differences in practice patterns, hemodialysis remains the most common therapeutic modality for ESRD (>90% of patients) in the United States. In contrast to hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis is continuous, but much less efficient, in terms of solute clearance. Although no large-scale clinical trials have been completed comparing outcomes among patients randomized to either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, outcomes associated with both therapies are similar in most reports, and the decision of which modality to select is often based on personal preferences and quality-of-life considerations. Hemodialysis relies on the principles of solute diffusion across a semipermeable membrane. Movement of metabolic waste products takes place down a concentration gradient from the circulation into the dialysate. The rate of diffusive transport increases in response to several factors, including the magnitude of the concentration gradient, the membrane surface area, and the mass transfer coefficient of the membrane. The latter is a function of the porosity and thickness of the membrane, the size of the solute molecule, and the conditions of flow on the two sides of the membrane. According to laws of diffusion, the larger the molecule, the slower is its rate of transfer across the membrane. A small molecule, such as urea (60 Da), undergoes substantial clearance, whereas a larger molecule, such as creatinine (113 Da), is cleared less efficiently. In addition to diffusive clearance, movement of waste products from the circulation into the dialysate may occur as a result of ultrafiltration. Convective clearance occurs because of solvent drag, with solutes being swept along with water across the semipermeable dialysis membrane. There are three essential components to hemodialysis: the dialyzer, the composition and delivery of the dialysate, and the blood delivery system (Fig. 336-1). The dialyzer is a plastic chamber with the ability to perfuse blood and dialysate compartments simultaneously at very high flow rates. The hollow-fiber dialyzer is the most common in use in the United States. These dialyzers are composed of bundles of capillary tubes through which blood circulates while dialysate travels on the outside of the fiber bundle. The majority of dialyzers now manufactured in the United States are “biocompatible” synthetic membranes derived from polysulfone or related compounds (versus older cellulose “bioincompatible” membranes that activated the complement cascade). The frequency of reprocessing and reuse of hemodialyzers and blood lines varies across the world. In general, as the cost of disposable supplies has decreased, their use has increased. Formaldehyde, peracetic acid–hydrogen peroxide, glutaraldehyde, and bleach have all been used as reprocessing agents. The potassium concentration of dialysate may be varied from 0 to 4 mmol/L depending on the predialysis serum potassium concentration. The usual dialysate calcium concentration is 1.25 mmol/L (2.5 meq/L), although modification may be required in selected settings (e.g., higher dialysate calcium concentrations may be used in patients with hypocalcemia associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism or following parathyroidectomy). The usual dialysate sodium concentration is 136– 140 mmol/L. In patients who frequently develop hypotension during their dialysis run, “sodium modeling” to counterbalance urea-related osmolar gradients is often used. With sodium modeling, the dialysate sodium concentration is gradually lowered from the range of 145–155 mmol/L to isotonic concentrations (136–140 mmol/L) near the end of the dialysis treatment, typically declining either in steps or in a linear or exponential fashion. Higher dialysate sodium concentrations and sodium modeling may predispose patients to positive sodium balance and increased thirst; thus, these strategies to ameliorate intradialytic hypotension may be undesirable in hypertensive patients or in patients with large interdialytic weight gains. Because patients are exposed to approximately 120 L of water during each dialysis treatment, water used for the dialysate is subjected to filtration, softening, deionization, and, ultimately, reverse osmosis to remove microbiologic contaminants and dissolved ions.

A, artery; V, vein. The blood delivery system is composed of the extracorporeal circuit and the dialysis access. The dialysis machine consists of a blood pump, dialysis solution delivery system, and various safety monitors. The blood pump moves blood from the access site, through the dialyzer, and back to the patient. The blood flow rate may range from 250–500 mL/min, depending on the type and integrity of the vascular access. Negative hydrostatic pressure on the dialysate side can be manipulated to achieve desirable fluid removal or ultrafiltration. Dialysis membranes have different ultrafiltration coefficients (i.e., mL removed/min per mmHg) so that along with hydrostatic changes, fluid removal can be varied. The dialysis solution delivery system dilutes the concentrated dialysate with water and monitors the temperature, conductivity, and flow of dialysate. The fistula, graft, or catheter through which blood is obtained for hemodialysis is often referred to as a dialysis access. A native fistula created by the anastomosis of an artery to a vein (e.g., the Brescia-Cimino fistula, in which the cephalic vein is anastomosed end-to-side to the radial artery) results in arterialization of the vein. This facilitates its subsequent use in the placement of large needles (typically 15 gauge) to access the circulation. Although fistulas have the highest long-term patency rate of all dialysis access options, fistulas are created in a minority of patients in the United States. Many patients undergo placement of an arteriovenous graft (i.e., the interposition of prosthetic material, usually polytetrafluoroethylene, between an artery and a vein) or a tunneled dialysis catheter. In recent years, nephrologists, vascular surgeons, and health care policy makers in the United States have encouraged creation of arteriovenous fistulas in a larger fraction of patients (the “fistula first” initiative). Unfortunately, even when created, arteriovenous fistulas may not mature sufficiently to provide reliable access to the circulation, or they may thrombose early in their development. Grafts and catheters tend to be used among persons with smaller-caliber veins or persons whose veins have been damaged by repeated venipuncture, or after prolonged hospitalization. The most important complication of arteriovenous grafts is thrombosis of the graft and graft failure, due principally to intimal hyperplasia at the anastomosis between the graft and recipient vein. When grafts (or fistulas) fail, catheter-guided angioplasty can be used to dilate stenoses; monitoring of venous pressures on dialysis and of access flow, although not routinely performed, may assist in the early recognition of impending vascular access failure. In addition to an increased rate of access failure, grafts and (in particular) catheters are associated with much higher rates of infection than fistulas. Intravenous large-bore catheters are often used in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease. For persons on maintenance hemodialysis, tunneled catheters (either two separate catheters or a single catheter with two lumens) are often used when arteriovenous fistulas and grafts have failed or are not feasible due to anatomic considerations. These catheters are tunneled under the skin; the tunnel reduces bacterial translocation from the skin, resulting in a lower infection rate than with nontunneled temporary catheters. Most tunneled catheters are placed in the internal jugular veins; the external jugular, femoral, and subclavian veins may also be used. Nephrologists, interventional radiologists, and vascular surgeons generally prefer to avoid placement of catheters into the subclavian veins; while flow rates are usually excellent, subclavian stenosis is a frequent complication and, if present, will likely prohibit permanent vascular access (i.e., a fistula or graft) in the ipsilateral extremity. Infection rates may be higher with femoral catheters. For patients with multiple vascular access complications and no other options for permanent vascular access, tunneled catheters may be the last “lifeline” for hemodialysis. Translumbar or transhepatic approaches into the inferior vena cava may be required if the superior vena cava or other central veins draining the upper extremities are stenosed or thrombosed. The hemodialysis procedure consists of pumping heparinized blood through the dialyzer at a flow rate of 300–500 mL/min, while dialysate flows in an opposite counter-current direction at 500–800 mL/ min. The efficiency of dialysis is determined by blood and dialysate flow through the dialyzer as well as dialyzer characteristics (i.e., its efficiency in removing solute). The dose of dialysis, which is currently defined as a derivation of the fractional urea clearance during a single 1824 treatment, is further governed by patient size, residual kidney function, dietary protein intake, the degree of anabolism or catabolism, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Since the landmark studies of Sargent and Gotch relating the measurement of the dose of dialysis using urea concentrations with morbidity in the National Cooperative Dialysis Study, the delivered dose of dialysis has been measured and considered as a quality assurance and improvement tool. Although the fractional removal of urea nitrogen and derivations thereof are considered to be the standard methods by which “adequacy of dialysis” is measured, a large multicenter randomized clinical trial (the HEMO Study) failed to show a difference in mortality associated with a large difference in urea clearance. Current targets include a urea reduction ratio (the fractional reduction in blood urea nitrogen per hemodialysis session) of >65–70% and a body water– indexed clearance × time product (KT/V) above 1.2 or 1.05, depending on whether urea concentrations are “equilibrated.” For the majority of patients with ESRD, between 9 and 12 h of dialysis are required each week, usually divided into three equal sessions. Several studies have suggested that longer hemodialysis session lengths may be beneficial (independent of urea clearance), although these studies are confounded by a variety of patient characteristics, including body size and nutritional status. Hemodialysis “dose” should be individualized, and factors other than the urea nitrogen should be considered, including the adequacy of ultrafiltration or fluid removal and control of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and metabolic acidosis. A recent randomized clinical trial (the Frequent Hemodialysis Network Trial) demonstrated improved control of hypertension and hyperphosphatemia, reduced left ventricular mass, and improved self-reported physical health with six times per week hemodialysis compared to the usual three times per week therapy. A companion trial in which frequent nocturnal hemodialysis was compared to conventional hemodialysis at home showed no significant effect on left ventricular mass or self-reported physical health. Finally, an evaluation of the U.S. Renal Data System registry showed a significant increase in mortality and hospitalization for heart failure after the longer interdialytic interval that occurs over the dialysis “weekend.”\n\n\n\nHypotension is the most common acute complication of hemodialysis, particularly among patients with diabetes mellitus. Numerous factors appear to increase the risk of hypotension, including excessive ultrafiltration with inadequate compensatory vascular filling, impaired vasoactive or autonomic responses, osmolar shifts, overzealous use of antihypertensive agents, and reduced cardiac reserve. Patients with arteriovenous fistulas and grafts may develop high-output cardiac failure due to shunting of blood through the dialysis access; on rare occasions, this may necessitate ligation of the fistula or graft. Because of the vasodilatory and cardiodepressive effects of acetate, its use as the buffer in dialysate was once a common cause of hypotension. Since the introduction of bicarbonate-containing dialysate, dialysis-associated hypotension has become less common. The management of hypotension during dialysis consists of discontinuing ultrafiltration, the administration of 100–250 mL of isotonic saline or 10 mL of 23% saturated hypertonic saline, or administration of salt-poor albumin. Hypotension during dialysis can frequently be prevented by careful evaluation of the dry weight and by ultrafiltration modeling, such that more fluid is removed at the beginning rather than the end of the dialysis procedure. Additional maneuvers include the performance of sequential ultrafiltration followed by dialysis, cooling of the dialysate during dialysis treatment, and avoiding heavy meals during dialysis. Midodrine, an oral selective α1 adrenergic agent, has been advocated by some practitioners, although there is insufficient evidence of its safety and efficacy to support its routine use. Muscle cramps during dialysis are also a common complication. The etiology of dialysis-associated cramps remains obscure. Changes in muscle perfusion because of excessively rapid volume removal (e.g., >10–12 mL/kg per hour) or targeted removal below the patient’s estimated dry weight often precipitate dialysis-associated cramps. Strategies that may be used to prevent cramps include reducing volume removal during dialysis, ultrafiltration profiling, and the use of sodium modeling (see above). Anaphylactoid reactions to the dialyzer, particularly on its first use, have been reported most frequently with the bioincompatible cellulosic-containing membranes. Dialyzer reactions can be divided into two types, A and B. Type A reactions are attributed to an IgEmediated intermediate hypersensitivity reaction to ethylene oxide used in the sterilization of new dialyzers. This reaction typically occurs soon after the initiation of a treatment (within the first few minutes) and can progress to full-blown anaphylaxis if the therapy is not promptly discontinued. Treatment with steroids or epinephrine may be needed if symptoms are severe. The type B reaction consists of a symptom complex of nonspecific chest and back pain, which appears to result from complement activation and cytokine release. These symptoms typically occur several minutes into the dialysis run and typically resolve over time with continued dialysis. In peritoneal dialysis, 1.5–3 L of a dextrose-containing solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity and allowed to dwell for a set period of time, usually 2–4 h. As with hemodialysis, toxic materials are removed through a combination of convective clearance generated through ultrafiltration and diffusive clearance down a concentration gradient. The clearance of solutes and water during a peritoneal dialysis exchange depends on the balance between the movement of solute and water into the peritoneal cavity versus absorption from the peritoneal cavity. The rate of diffusion diminishes with time and eventually stops when equilibration between plasma and dialysate is reached. Absorption of solutes and water from the peritoneal cavity occurs across the peritoneal membrane into the peritoneal capillary circulation and via peritoneal lymphatics into the lymphatic circulation. The rate of peritoneal solute transport varies from patient to patient and may be altered by the presence of infection (peritonitis), drugs, and physical factors such as position and exercise. Peritoneal dialysis may be carried out as CAPD, CCPD, or a combination of both. In CAPD, dialysate is manually infused into the peritoneal cavity and exchanged three to five times during the day. A nighttime dwell is frequently instilled at bedtime and remains in the peritoneal cavity through the night. In CCPD, exchanges are performed in an automated fashion, usually at night; the patient is connected to an automated cycler that performs a series of exchange cycles while the patient sleeps. The number of exchange cycles required to optimize peritoneal solute clearance varies by the peritoneal membrane characteristics; as with hemodialysis, solute clearance should be tracked to ensure dialysis “adequacy.”\n\n\n\nPeritoneal dialysis solutions are available in volumes typically ranging from 1.5 to 3 L. The major difference between the dialysate used for peritoneal dialysis rather than hemodialysis is that the hypertonicity of peritoneal dialysis solutions drives solute and fluid removal, whereas solute removal in hemodialysis depends on concentration gradients, and fluid removal requires transmembrane pressure. Typically, dextrose at varying concentrations contributes to the hypertonicity of peritoneal dialysate. Icodextrin is a nonabsorbable carbohydrate that can be used in place of dextrose. Studies have demonstrated more efficient ultrafiltration with icodextrin than with dextrose-containing solutions. Icodextrin is typically used as the “last fill” for patients on CCPD or for the longest dwell in patients on CAPD. The most common additives to peritoneal dialysis solutions are heparin to prevent obstruction of the dialysis catheter lumen with fibrin and antibiotics during an episode of acute peritonitis. Insulin may also be added in patients with diabetes mellitus. Access to the peritoneal cavity is obtained through a peritoneal catheter. Catheters used for maintenance peritoneal dialysis are flexible, being made of silicone rubber with numerous side holes at the distal end. These catheters usually have two Dacron cuffs. The scarring that occurs around the cuffs anchors the catheter and seals it from bacteria tracking from the skin surface into the peritoneal cavity; it also prevents the external leakage of fluid from the peritoneal cavity. The cuffs are placed in the preperitoneal plane and ~2 cm from the skin surface. The peritoneal equilibrium test is a formal evaluation of peritoneal membrane characteristics that measures the transfer rates of creatinine and glucose across the peritoneal membrane. Patients are classified as low, low–average, high–average, and high transporters. Patients with rapid equilibration (i.e., high transporters) tend to absorb more glucose and lose efficiency of ultrafiltration with long daytime dwells. High transporters also tend to lose larger quantities of albumin and other proteins across the peritoneal membrane. In general, patients with rapid transporting characteristics require more frequent, shorter dwell time exchanges, nearly always obligating use of a cycler. Slower (low and low–average) transporters tend to do well with fewer exchanges. The efficiency of solute clearance also depends on the volume of dialysate infused. Larger volumes allow for greater solute clearance, particularly with CAPD in patients with low and low– average transport characteristics. As with hemodialysis, the optimal dose of peritoneal dialysis is unknown. Several observational studies have suggested that higher rates of urea and creatinine clearance (the latter generally measured in liters per week) are associated with lower mortality rates and fewer uremic complications. However, a randomized clinical trial (Adequacy of Peritoneal Dialysis in Mexico [ADEMEX]) failed to show a significant reduction in mortality or complications with a relatively large increment in urea clearance. In general, patients on peritoneal dialysis do well when they retain residual kidney function. The rates of technique failure increase with years on dialysis and have been correlated with loss of residual function to a greater extent than loss of peritoneal membrane capacity. For some patients in whom CCPD does not provide sufficient solute clearance, a hybrid approach can be adopted where one or more daytime exchanges are added to the CCPD regimen. Although this approach can enhance solute clearance and prolong a patient’s capacity to remain on peritoneal dialysis, the burden of the hybrid approach can be overwhelming. The major complications of peritoneal dialysis are peritonitis, catheter-associated nonperitonitis infections, weight gain and other metabolic disturbances, and residual uremia (especially among patients with no residual kidney function). Peritonitis typically develops when there has been a break in sterile technique during one or more of the exchange procedures. Peritonitis is usually defined by an elevated peritoneal fluid leukocyte count (100/μL, of which at least 50% are polymorphonuclear neutrophils); these cutoffs are lower than in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis because of the presence of dextrose in peritoneal dialysis solutions and rapid bacterial proliferation in this environment without antibiotic therapy. The clinical presentation typically consists of pain and cloudy dialysate, often with fever and other constitutional symptoms. The most common culprit organisms are gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus, reflecting the origin from the skin. Gram-negative rod infections are less common; fungal and mycobacterial infections can be seen in selected patients, particularly after antibacterial therapy. Most cases of peritonitis can be managed either with intraperitoneal or oral antibiotics, depending on the organism; many patients with peritonitis do not require hospitalization. In cases where peritonitis is due to hydrophilic gram-negative rods (e.g., Pseudomonas sp.) or yeast, antimicrobial therapy is usually not sufficient, and catheter removal is required to ensure complete eradication of infection. Nonperitonitis catheter-associated infections (often termed tunnel infections) vary widely in severity. Some cases can be managed with local antibiotic or silver nitrate administration, whereas others are severe enough to require parenteral antibiotic therapy and catheter removal. Peritoneal dialysis is associated with a variety of metabolic complications. Albumin and other proteins can be lost across the peritoneal membrane in concert with the loss of metabolic wastes. Hypoproteinemia obligates a higher dietary protein intake in order to maintain nitrogen balance. Hyperglycemia and weight gain are also common complications of peritoneal dialysis. Several hundred calories in the form of dextrose are absorbed each day, depending on the concentration 1825 employed. Peritoneal dialysis patients, particularly those with diabetes mellitus, are then prone to other complications of insulin resistance, including hypertriglyceridemia. On the positive side, the continuous nature of peritoneal dialysis usually allows for a more liberal diet, due to continuous removal of potassium and phosphorus—two major dietary components whose accumulation can be hazardous in ESRD. Cardiovascular disease constitutes the major cause of death in patients with ESRD. Cardiovascular mortality and event rates are higher in dialysis patients than in patients after transplantation, although rates are extraordinarily high in both populations. The underlying cause of cardiovascular disease is unclear but may be related to shared risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerotic and arteriosclerotic vascular disease), chronic inflammation, massive changes in extracellular volume (especially with high interdialytic weight gains), inadequate treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, anemia, dystrophic vascular calcification, hyperhomocysteinemia, and, perhaps, alterations in cardiovascular dynamics during the dialysis treatment. Few studies have targeted cardiovascular risk reduction in ESRD patients; none have demonstrated consistent benefit. Two clinical trials of statin agents in ESRD demonstrated significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, but no significant reductions in death or cardiovascular events (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie [4D] and A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis [AURORA]). The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), which included patients on dialysisand nondialysis-requiring CKD, showed a 17% reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events or cardiovascular death with simvastatin-ezetimibe treatment. Most experts recommend conventional cardioprotective strategies (e.g., lipid-lowering agents, aspirin, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and β-adrenergic antagonists) in dialysis patients based on the patients’ cardiovascular risk profile, which appears to be increased by more than an order of magnitude relative to persons unaffected by kidney disease. Other complications of ESRD include a high incidence of infection, progressive debility and frailty, protein-energy malnutrition, and impaired cognitive function. The incidence of ESRD is increasing worldwide with longer life expectancies and improved care of infectious and cardiovascular diseases. The management of ESRD varies widely by country and within country by region, and it is influenced by economic and other major factors. In general, peritoneal dialysis is more commonly performed in poorer countries owing to its lower expense and the high cost of establishing in-center hemodialysis units. transplantation in the treatment 337 of renal Failure\n\n\n\nJamil Azzi, Edgar L.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['iii.

","['Curr Opin Cell Biol 2014;27:18. Propranolol, a β-adrenoceptor antagonist, is a useful antihy-pertensive agent because it reduces cardiac output and prob-ably vascular resistance as well. However, it also prevents β-adrenoceptor–induced bronchodilation and therefore may precipitate bronchoconstriction in susceptible individuals. Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil also reduce blood pressure but, because they act on a different target, rarely cause bronchoconstriction or prevent bronchodila-tion. An alternative approach in this patient would be to use a more highly selective adrenoceptor antagonist drug (such as metoprolol) that binds preferentially to the β1 subtype, which is a major βadrenoceptor in the heart, and has a lower affinity (ie, higher Kd) for binding the β2 subtype that mediates bronchodilation.

","['It is important to determine the precise time of appearance and rate of progression of the symptoms experienced by the patient. The rapid onset of a neurologic complaint, occurring within seconds or minutes, usually indicates a vascular event, a seizure, or migraine. The onset of sensory symptoms located in one extremity that spread over a few seconds to adjacent portions of that extremity and then to the other regions of the body suggests a seizure. A more gradual onset and less well-localized symptoms point to the possibility of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A similar but slower temporal march of symptoms accompanied by headache, nausea, or visual disturbance suggests migraine. The presence of “positive” sensory symptoms (e.g., tingling or sensations that are difficult to describe) or involuntary motor movements suggests a seizure; in contrast, transient loss of function (negative symptoms) suggests a TIA. A stuttering onset where symptoms appear, stabilize, and then progress over hours or days also suggests cerebrovascular disease; an additional history of transient remission or regression indicates that the process is more likely due to ischemia rather than hemorrhage. A gradual evolution of symptoms over hours or days suggests a toxic, metabolic, infectious, or inflammatory process. Progressing symptoms associated with the systemic manifestations of fever, stiff neck, and altered level of consciousness imply an infectious process. Relapsing and remitting symptoms involving different levels of the nervous system suggest MS or other inflammatory processes. Slowly progressive symptoms without remissions are characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders, chronic infections, gradual intoxications, and neoplasms. 2.', 'Organisms can also be identified by direct examination of the blood. Treatment consists of benzimidazole (2.5 mg/kg bid) or nifurtimox (2 mg/kg qid) for at least 60 days, followed by maintenance therapy for the duration of immunodeficiency with either drug at a dose of 5 mg/kg three times a week. As is the case with cerebral toxoplasmosis, successful therapy with antiretrovirals may allow discontinuation of therapy for Chagas’ disease. Stroke may occur in patients with HIV infection. In contrast to the other causes of focal neurologic deficits in patients with HIV infection, the symptoms of a stroke are sudden in onset. Patients with HIV infection have an increased prevalence of many classic risk factors associated with stroke, including smoking and diabetes. It has been reported that HIV infection itself can lead to an increase in carotid artery stiffness. The relative increase in risk for stroke as a consequence of HIV infection is more pronounced in women and in individuals between the ages of 18 and 29. Among the secondary infectious diseases in patients with HIV infection that may be associated with stroke are vasculitis due to cerebral varicella zoster or neurosyphilis and septic embolism in association with fungal infection. Other elements of the differential diagnosis of stroke in the patient with HIV infection include atherosclerotic cerebral vascular disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and cocaine or amphetamine use. Primary CNS lymphoma is discussed below in the section on neoplastic diseases. Spinal cord disease, or myelopathy, is present in ~20% of patients with AIDS, often as part of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. In fact, 90% of the patients with HIV-associated myelopathy have some evidence of dementia, suggesting that similar pathologic processes may be responsible for both conditions. Three main types of spinal cord disease are seen in patients with AIDS. The first of these is a vacuolar myelopathy, as mentioned above. This condition is pathologically similar to subacute combined degeneration of the cord, such as that occurring with pernicious anemia. Although vitamin B12 deficiency can be seen in patients with AIDS as a primary complication of HIV infection, it does not appear to be responsible for the myelopathy seen in the majority of patients. Vacuolar myelopathy is characterized by a subacute onset and often presents with gait disturbances, predominantly ataxia and spasticity; it may progress to include bladder and bowel dysfunction. Physical findings include evidence of increased deep tendon reflexes and extensor plantar responses. The second form of spinal cord disease involves the dorsal columns and presents as a pure sensory ataxia. The third form is also sensory in nature and presents with paresthesias and dysesthesias of the lower extremities. In contrast to the cognitive problems seen in patients with HIV encephalopathy, these spinal cord syndromes do not respond well to antiretroviral drugs, and therapy is mainly supportive. One important disease of the spinal cord that also involves the peripheral nerves is a myelopathy and polyradiculopathy seen in association with CMV infection. This entity is generally seen late in the course of HIV infection and is fulminant in onset, with lower extremity and sacral paresthesias, difficulty in walking, areflexia, ascending sensory loss, and urinary retention. The clinical course is rapidly progressive over a period of weeks. CSF examination reveals a predominantly neutrophilic pleocytosis, and CMV DNA can be detected by CSF PCR. Therapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet can lead to rapid improvement, and prompt initiation of foscarnet or ganciclovir therapy is important in minimizing the degree of permanent neurologic damage. Combination therapy with both drugs should be considered in patients who have been previously treated for CMV disease.

","['The patient is anorectic and often nauseated. Vomiting is relatively common and may produce symptoms and signs of vascular and extracellular volume depletion. Jaundice is unusual early in the course of acute cholecystitis but may occur when edematous inflammatory changes involve the bile ducts and surrounding lymph nodes. A low-grade fever is characteristically present, but shaking chills or rigors are not uncommon. The RUQ of the abdomen is almost invariably tender to palpation. An enlarged, tense gallbladder is palpable in 25–50% of patients. Deep inspiration or cough during subcostal palpation of the RUQ usually produces increased pain and inspiratory arrest (Murphy’s sign). Localized rebound tenderness in the RUQ is common, as are abdominal distention and hypoactive bowel sounds from paralytic ileus, but generalized peritoneal signs and abdominal rigidity are usually lacking, in the absence of perforation. The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is usually made on the basis of a characteristic history and physical examination. The triad of sudden onset of RUQ tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis is highly suggestive. Typically, leukocytosis in the range of 10,000–15,000 cells per microliter with a left shift on differential count is found. The serum bilirubin is mildly elevated (<85.5 μmol/L [5 mg/dL]) in fewer than half of patients, whereas about one-fourth have modest elevations in serum aminotransferases (usually less than a fivefold elevation). Ultrasound will demonstrate calculi in 90–95% of cases and is useful for detection of signs of gallbladder inflammation including thickening of the wall, pericholecystic fluid, and dilatation of the bile duct. The radionuclide (e.g., HIDA) biliary scan may be confirmatory if bile duct imaging is seen without visualization of the gallbladder. Approximately 75% of patients treated medically have remission of acute symptoms within 2–7 days following hospitalization. In 25%, however, a complication of acute cholecystitis will occur despite conservative treatment (see below). In this setting, prompt surgical intervention is required. Of the 75% of patients with acute cholecystitis who undergo remission of symptoms, ∼25% will experience a recurrence of cholecystitis within 1 year, and 60% will have at least one recurrent bout within 6 years. In view of the natural history of the disease, acute cholecystitis is best treated by early surgery whenever possible. Mirizzi’s syndrome is a rare complication in which a gallstone becomes impacted in the cystic duct or neck of the gallbladder causing compression of the CBD, resulting in CBD obstruction and jaundice. Ultrasound shows gallstone(s) lying outside the hepatic duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Fig. 369-2B), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) will usually demonstrate the characteristic extrinsic compression of the CBD. Surgery consists of removing the cystic duct, diseased gallbladder, and the impacted stone. The preoperative diagnosis of Mirizzi’s syndrome is important to avoid CBD injury. acalculous cHolecystitis In 5–10% of patients with acute cholecystitis, calculi obstructing the cystic duct are not found at surgery. In >50% of such cases, an underlying explanation for acalculous inflammation is not found. An increased risk for the development of acalculous cholecystitis is especially associated with serious trauma or burns, with the postpartum period following prolonged labor, and with orthopedic and other nonbiliary major surgical operations in the postoperative period. It may possibly complicate periods of prolonged parenteral hyperalimentation. For some of these cases, biliary sludge in the cystic duct may be responsible. Other precipitating factors include vasculitis, obstructing adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, diabetes mellitus, torsion of the gallbladder, “unusual” bacterial infections of the gallbladder (e.g., Leptospira, Streptococcus, Salmonella, or Vibrio cholerae), and parasitic infestation of the gallbladder. Acalculous cholecystitis may also be seen with a variety of other systemic disease processes (e.g., sarcoidosis, cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, syphilis, actinomycosis). Although the clinical manifestations of acalculous cholecystitis are indistinguishable from those of calculous cholecystitis, the setting of acute gallbladder inflammation complicating severe underlying illness is characteristic of acalculous disease. Ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) examinations demonstrating a large, tense, static gallbladder without stones and with evidence of poor emptying over a prolonged period may be diagnostically useful in some cases. The complication rate for acalculous cholecystitis exceeds that for calculous cholecystitis. Successful management of acute acalculous cholecystitis appears to depend primarily on early diagnosis and surgical intervention, with meticulous attention to postoperative care. acalculous cHolecystopatHy Disordered motility of the gallbladder can produce recurrent biliary pain in patients without gallstones. Infusion of an octapeptide of CCK can be used to measure the gallbladder ejection fraction during cholescintigraphy. The surgical findings have included abnormalities such as chronic cholecystitis, gallbladder muscle hypertrophy, and/or a markedly narrowed cystic duct. Some of these patients may well have had antecedent gallbladder disease. The following criteria can be used to identify patients with acalculous cholecystopathy: (1) recurrent episodes of typical RUQ pain characteristic of biliary tract pain, (2) abnormal CCK cholescintigraphy demonstrating a gallbladder ejection fraction of <40%, and (3) infusion of CCK reproducing the patient’s pain. An additional clue would be the identification of a large gallbladder on ultrasound examination. Finally, it should be noted that sphincter of Oddi dysfunction can also give rise to recurrent RUQ pain and CCK-scintigraphic abnormalities. empHysematous cHolecystitis So-called emphysematous cholecystitis is thought to begin with acute cholecystitis (calculous or acalculous) followed by ischemia or gangrene of the gallbladder wall and infection by gas-producing organisms. Bacteria most frequently cultured in this setting include anaerobes, such as Clostridium welchii or Clostridium perfringens, and aerobes, such as E.', 'Acute cholecystitis, ultrasound.

Other etiologies include bile duct stricture and malignancy (biliary or pancreatic). Gram-enterics (e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas) are commonly identified pathogens. Charcot’s triad—RUQ pain, jaundice, and fever/chills—is classic and seen in 50–70% of cases. Reynolds’ pentad—Charcot’s triad plus septic shock and altered mental status—may be present in acute suppurative cholangitis and suggests sepsis. Look for leukocytosis, ↑ bilirubin, and ↑ alkaline phosphatase (see Table 2.6-7). Obtain blood cultures to rule out sepsis. Ultrasound or CT may be a useful adjunct, but diagnosis is often clinical. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a noninvasive test that may also be useful. ERCP is both diagnostic and therapeutic (biliary drainage).

"A 17-year-old girl comes to the urgent care center after testing negative for HIV. She recently had sexual intercourse for the first time and had used a condom with her long-term boyfriend. She has no personal history of serious illness and no history of sexually transmitted infections. However, the patient is still worried about the possibility she has HIV despite the negative HIV test. She states that the package insert of the HIV test shows that of 100 patients who are found to be HIV-positive on PCR, 91 tested positive via the HIV test. Later in the day, a 23-year-old woman with a history of genitourinary chlamydia infection also comes to the urgent care center after testing negative for HIV. She states that she recently had unprotected intercourse with “someone who might have HIV.” If the test is conducted a second time on the 23-year-old patient, how will its performance compare to a second test conducted on the 17-year-old patient?

Several clinical prediction systems (Fig. 44-2) can increase the sensitivity of rapid antigen-detection tests to >90% in controlled settings. Since the\n\n\n\nPART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases\n\n\n\nSymptoms consistent with viral URI? Risk factors for HIV, gonorrhea?', 'Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. ■Specificity is the probability that a patient without a disease will have a test result. A specific test will rarely determine that someone has the disease when in fact they do not and is therefore good at ruling people in. The ideal test is both sensitive and specifc, but a trade-off must often be made between sensitivity and specif city. High sensitivity is particularly desirable when there is a signif cant penalty for missing a disease. It is also desirable early in a diagnostic workup, when it is necessary to reduce a broad differential. Example: An initial ELISA test for HIV infection. High specificity is useful for confrming a likely diagnosis or for situations in which false-results may prove harmful. Example: A Western blot confrmatory HIV test. Example: You search for your physician, Mary Adel, MD, in the local phone book. Identifying all individuals named “Mary” would be a sensitive test, as anyone named Mary Adel would likely be included in the results. However, it is not specif c, as numerous other physicians would also be included. Remember the mnemonic “Snout”: High SENsitivity would allow one to rule out physicians not listed with this f rst name. Identifying only individuals with the full name “Mary Lucy Adel IV” is very specifc, since individuals not named Mary Adel are especially likely to be declined. However, it is not sensitive, as she may be overlooked if she is not listed by her complete name. Remember the mnemonic “SPin”: High SPecifcity would allow one to rule in physicians listed with this full name. Once a test has been administered and a patient’s result has been made available, that result must be interpreted through use of predictive values (or post-test probabilities):\n\n\n\nThe positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a patient with a  test result truly has the disease. The more specifc a test, the higher its PPV. The higher the disease prevalence, the higher the PPV of the test for that disease. The negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that a patient with a  test result truly does not have the disease. The more sensitive a test, the higher its NPV. The lower the disease prevalence, the higher the NPV of the test for that disease. Another way to describe the performance of a diagnostic test involves the use of likelihood ratios (LRs), which express how much more or less likely a given test result is in diseased as opposed to nondiseased people:\n\n\n\nDiseased people with a test result Sensitivity\n\n\n\nNondiseased people with a test result 1 − specif city\n\n\n\nSnOUT: Sensitive tests rule OUT disease. SpIN: Specific tests rule IN disease. Because the predictive value of a test is affected by disease prevalence, it is advantageous to apply diagnostic tests to patients with an ↑ likelihood of having the disease being sought (i.e., an at-risk population). If a test has an LR of 1, it does not change the pretest probability of disease. If the LR is 10, it makes disease 45% more likely. If the LR is 0.1, disease is 45% less likely. Diseased people with a test result 1 − sensitivity\n\n\n\nNondiseased people with a test result Specif city\n\n\n\nIf you see a set of COworkers being followed over time, think COhort study. Cohort studies are also known as longitudinal studies or incidence studies. Knowledge of risk factors may be used to predict future disease in a given patient. Risk factors may be causal (immediate or distant causes of disease) or disease markers (in which removing the risk factor does not necessarily ↓ the likelihood of disease). Risk factors can be diffcult to discover for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\n\n\nA disease may have a long latency period, with risky exposures remote and forgotten. A risky exposure may be so common that its impact is hard to discern. Disease incidence may be low, and it is hard to draw conclusions from infrequent events. Risk associated with any individual exposure is small and hard to parse out. There is seldom a close, constant relationship between a risk factor and a disease. The best way to determine whether an exposure actually ↑ disease risk is with a prospective study. The ideal study for risk factor assessment would be an experiment in which the researcher controls risk exposure and then relates it to disease incidence. Doing so, however, may be unethical as well as prohibitively intrusive, time consuming, and expensive. Instead, observational studies such as cohort or case-control studies are used to determine risk. In a cohort study, a group of people is assembled, none of whom have the outcome of interest (i.e., the disease), but all of whom could potentially experience that outcome. For each possible risk factor, the members of the cohort are classifed as either exposed or unexposed. All the cohort members are then followed over time, and rates of outcome events are compared in the two exposure groups. Advantages of cohort studies are as follows:\n\n\n\nThey follow the same logic as the clinical question (if people are exposed, will they get the disease?). They are the only way to directly determine incidence. They can be used to assess the relationship of a given exposure to many diseases. In prospective studies, exposure is elicited without bias from a known outcome. The disadvantages of such studies include the following:\n\n\n\nThey can be time consuming and expensive. Studies assess only the relationship of the disease to the few exposure factors recorded at the start of the study. They require many subjects and are thus ineffcient and cannot be used to study rare diseases. Cohort studies may be prospective—in which a cohort is assembled in the present and followed into the future—or they may be retrospective, in which a cohort is identifed from past records and followed to the present. Case-control studies are essentially cohort studies in reverse. In such studies, a researcher selects two groups—one with disease (cases) and one without (controls)—and then looks back in time to measure the comparative frequency of exposure to a possible risk factor in the two groups. The validity of a case-control study depends on appropriate selection of cases and controls, the manner in which exposure is measured, and the manner in which extraneous variables (confounders) are dealt with. Cases and controls should be comparable in terms of opportunity for exposure (i.e., they should be members of the same base population with an equal opportunity of risk factor exposure). Cases should be newly diagnosed using explicit criteria for diagnosis. Exposures should be assessed in as unbiased a fashion as possible. Confounding may be ↓ by matching subjects or through the stratif cation of subjects. Multivariable analysis may be helpful in this context. Advantages of such studies are as follows:\n\n\n\nStudies use small groups, thereby reducing expense. They can be used to study rare diseases and can easily examine multiple risk factors. Disadvantages include the following:\n\n\n\nStudies cannot calculate disease prevalence, incidence, or relative risk, because the numbers of subjects with and without a disease are determined artifcially by the investigator rather than by nature (an odds ratio can be used to estimate relative risk). Retrospective data may be inaccurate owing to recall or survivorship biases. If alcohol intake among individuals with breast cancer is compared with that of individuals without breast cancer, think case-control study. Absolute risk: The number of finger injuries among hospital staff this week. There are several ways to express and compare risk. These include the following:\n\n\n\nAbsolute risk: Defned as the incidence of disease. Attributable risk (or risk difference): The additional incidence of disease that is due to a risky exposure, on top of the background incidence from other causes. Attributable risk = Incidence of disease in exposed – Incidence in unexposed\n\n\n\nRelative risk (or risk ratio): Expresses how much more likely an exposed person is to get disease in comparison to an unexposed person. This indicates the strength of the association between exposure and disease, making it useful when one is considering disease etiology. ■ Odds ratio: An estimate of relative risk that is used in case-control studies. The odds ratio tells how much more likely it is that a person with a disease has been exposed to a risk factor than someone without the disease. The\n\n\n\nAttributable risk: (number of injuries among staff who used scissors) – (number of injuries among staff who did not use scissors). Relative risk: (number of injuries among staff who used scissors) ÷ (number of injuries among staff who did not use scissors). F IGU R E 2.4-2. Relative risk (RR) vs. odds ratio (OR). lower the disease incidence, the more closely it approximates relative risk (see Figure 2.4-2). Odds that a diseased person is exposed Odds ratio = Odds that a nondiseased person is exposed\n\n\n\nOdds ratio: (odds that injured staff used scissors) ÷ (odds that uninjured staff used scissors). Once a diagnosis has been established, it is important to be able to describe the associated prognosis. Survival analysis is used to summarize the average time from one event (e.g., presentation, diagnosis, or start of treatment) to any outcome that can occur only once during follow-up (e.g., death or recurrence of cancer). The usual method is with a Kaplan-Meier curve (see Figure 2.4-3) describing the survival (or time-to-event if the measured outcome is not death) in a cohort of patients, with the probability of survival de\n\n\n\nProbability of event creasing over time as patients die or drop out (are censored) from the study.

Although the gold standard for such evaluation is a randomized, double-masked controlled trial, other types of studies may be used as well (e.g., an observational\n\n\n\nF IGU R E 2.4-3. Example of a Kaplan-Meier curve. study, in which the exposure in question is a therapeutic intervention). In descending order of quality, published studies regarding treatment options include meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and case series/case reports. A randomized controlled trial is an experimental, prospective study in which subjects are randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Random assignment helps ensure that the two groups are truly comparable. The control group may be treated with a placebo or with the accepted standard of care. The study may be masked in one of two ways: single-masked, in which patients do not know which treatment group they are in, or double-masked, in which neither the patients nor their physicians know who is in which group. Double-masked studies are the gold standard for studying treatment effects. Advantages of randomized controlled trials are as follows:\n\n\n\nThey involve minimal bias. They have the potential to demonstrate causal relationships. Disadvantages include the following:\n\n\n\nThey are costly and time intensive. Informed consent may be diffcult to obtain. Some interventions (e.g., surgery) are not amenable to masking. Ethical standards cannot allow all variables to be controlled. Def ned as any process that causes results to systematically differ from the truth. Good studies and data analyses seek to minimize potential bias. Types of bias include the following:\n\n\n\nSelection bias: Occurs when samples or participants are selected that differ from other groups in additional determinants of outcome. Examples: A surgeon may select patients without signifcant comorbid conditions to receive surgery, resulting in unexpectedly positive outcomes compared to previous studies. Similarly, individuals concerned about a family history of breast cancer may be more likely to self-select in entering a mammography program, giving the impression of a prevalence that is higher than reality. Measurement bias: Occurs when measurement or data-gathering methods differ between groups. Example: One group is assessed by CT while another group is assessed by MRI. Confounding bias: Occurs when a third variable is associated with both the dependent variable and the independent variable (either positively or negatively), inducing a falseassociation (type I bias). Example: Fishermen in an area may experience a higher incidence of cataracts than the general population. However, becoming a fsherman will not in itself give you cataracts; rather, it is the sunlight to which those fshermen are exposed in their outdoor work. Recall bias: Results from a difference between two groups in the retrospective recall of past factors or outcomes. Example: A patient with cancer may be more motivated than a healthy individual to recall past episodes of chemical exposure. Lead-time bias: Results from earlier detection of disease, giving an appearance of prolonged survival when in fact the natural course is not altered. Example: A new and widely used screening test that detects cancer f ve\n\n\n\nRandomization minimizes bias and confounding; double-blinded studies prevent observation bias. Studies that are masked and randomized are better protected from the effects of bias, whereas observational studies are particularly susceptible to bias. Confounding variables reduce the internal validity of a study. years earlier may give the impression that patients are living longer with the disease. ■ Length bias: Occurs when screening tests detect a disproportionate number of slowly progressive diseases but miss rapidly progressive ones, leading to overestimation of the beneft of the screen. Example: A better prognosis for patients with cancer is celebrated after implementation of a new screening program. However, this test disproportionally detects slow-growing tumors, which generally tend to be less aggressive. Even with bias reduction, unsystematic random error is unavoidable owing to chance variation in studied data. Types of errors are as follows:\n\n\n\nType I (α) error:\n\n\n\nDefned as the probability of saying that there is a difference in treatment effects between groups when in fact there is not (i.e., a false-conclusion). The p-value is an estimate of the probability that differences in treatment effects in a study could have happened by chance alone. Classically, differences associated with a p < 0.05 are statistically signif cant. Type II (β) error:\n\n\n\nDefned as the probability of saying that there is no difference in treatment effects (i.e., a falseconclusion) when in fact a difference exists. Power is the probability that a study will fnd a statistically signif cant difference when one is truly there. It relates directly to the number of subjects. Power (β) = 1 – type II error. The confidence interval (CI) is a way of expressing statistical signif cance (p-value) that shows the size of the effect and the statistical power. CIs are interpreted as follows:\n\n\n\nIf one is using a 95% CI, there is a 95% chance that the interval contains the true effect size, which is likely to be closest to the point estimate near the center of the interval. Example: You would like to estimate the percentage of women with a specifc disease. A 10% result from a sample of 3000 women would provide a 95% CI of 9%–11%, whereas a 10% f nding from a sample of 30 women would yield a CI of –1% of 21%. The frst case has more power because the sample size is larger, producing a narrow interval. In the latter case, you cannot state with 95% certainty that women in general even have the disease! If the CI includes the value corresponding to a relative risk of 1.0 (i.e., zero treatment difference), the results are not statistically signif cant. If the CI is wide, power is low. ■There are three levels of prevention: 1° prevention: Includes measures to ↓ the incidence of disease. 2° prevention: Focuses on identifying the disease early, when it is asymptomatic or mild, and implementing measures that can halt or slow disease progression. 3° prevention: Includes measures that ↓ morbidity or mortality resulting from the presence of disease.

","['55-3A). When this strategy is unrevealing, simple triage tests are often warranted to direct the choice of more complex investigations (Fig. 55-3B). The history, physical examination (Table 55-4), and routine blood studies should attempt to characterize the mechanism of diarrhea, identify diagnostically helpful associations, and assess the patient’s fluid/electrolyte and nutritional status. Patients should be questioned about the onset, duration, pattern, aggravating (especially diet) and relieving factors, and stool characteristics of their diarrhea. The presence or absence of fecal incontinence, fever, weight loss, pain, certain exposures (travel, medications, contacts with diarrhea), and common extraintestinal manifestations (skin changes, arthralgias, oral aphthous ulcers) should be noted. A family history of IBD or sprue may indicate those possibilities. Physical findings may offer clues such as a thyroid mass, wheezing, heart murmurs, edema, hepatomegaly, abdominal masses, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous abnormalities, perianal fistulas, or anal sphincter laxity. Peripheral blood leukocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein suggests inflammation; anemia reflects blood loss or nutritional deficiencies; or eosinophilia may occur with parasitoses, neoplasia, collagen-vascular disease, allergy, or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Blood chemistries may demonstrate electrolyte, hepatic, or other metabolic disturbances. Measuring IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies may help detect celiac disease. Bile acid diarrhea is confirmed by a scintigraphic radiolabeled bile acid retention test; however, this is not available in many countries. Alternative approaches are a screening blood test (serum C4 or FGF-19), measurement of fecal bile acids, or a therapeutic trial with a bile acid sequestrant (e.g., cholestyramine or colesevelam). A therapeutic trial is often appropriate, definitive, and highly cost-effective when a specific diagnosis is suggested on the initial physician encounter. For example, chronic watery diarrhea, which ceases with fasting in an otherwise healthy young adult, may justify a trial of a lactose-restricted diet; bloating and diarrhea persisting since a mountain backpacking trip may warrant a trial of metronidazole for likely giardiasis; and postprandial diarrhea persisting following resection of terminal ileum might be due to bile acid malabsorption and be treated with cholestyramine or colesevelam before further evaluation. Persistent symptoms require additional investigation. Certain diagnoses may be suggested on the initial encounter (e.g., idiopathic IBD); however, additional focused evaluations may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and characterize the severity or extent of disease so that treatment can be best guided. Patients suspected of having IBS should be initially evaluated with flexible sigmoidoscopy with colorectal biopsies to exclude IBD, or particularly microscopic colitis, which is clinically indistinguishable from IBS with diarrhea; those with normal findings might be reassured and, as indicated, treated empirically with antispasmodics, antidiarrheals, or antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic agents). Any patient who presents with chronic diarrhea and hematochezia should be evaluated with stool microbiologic studies and colonoscopy. In an estimated two-thirds of cases, the cause for chronic diarrhea remains unclear after the initial encounter, and further testing is required.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (Chaps. 72, 129, and 140) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (Chaps. 140, 186, and 191) are closely related and are noninfectious causes of fever and petechiae. Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis (leukocytoclastic vasculitis) typically manifests as palpable purpura and has a wide variety of causes (Chap. 72). The presence of an ulcer or eschar in the setting of a more widespread eruption can provide an important diagnostic clue. For example, the presence of an eschar may suggest the diagnosis of scrub typhus or rickettsialpox (Chap. 211) in the appropriate setting. In other illnesses (e.g., anthrax) (Chap. 261e), an ulcer or eschar may be the only skin manifestation. ChaPter 26 Fever of Unknown Origin\n\n\n\nAtlas of Rashes Associated with Fever Kenneth M.

Blood smears from patients at risk for severe parasitic disease, such as malaria or babesiosis (Chap. 250e), must be examined for the diagnosis and quantitation of parasitemia. Blood smears may also be diagnostic in ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. Patients with possible meningitis should have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drawn before the initiation of antibiotic therapy.

Women with complicated pregnancies-for example, with twins or diabetes-often require return visits at 1-to 2-week intervals (Luke, 2003; Power, 2013). In 1986, the Department of Health and Human Services convened an expert panel to review the content of prenatal care. his report was subsequently reevaluated and revised in 2005 (Gregory, 2006). he panel recommended, among other things, early and continuing risk assessment that is patient speciic. It also endorsed lexibility in clinical visit spacing; health promotion and education, including preconceptional care; medical and psychosocial interventions; standardized documentation; and expanded prenatal care objectives-to include family health up to 1 year after birth. he World Health Organization conducted a multicenter randomized trial with almost 25,000 women comparing routine prenatal care with an experimental model designed to minimize visits (Villar, 2001). In the new model, women were seen once in the irst trimester and screened for certain risks. hose without anticipated complications-80 percent of those screened-were seen again at 26, 32, and 38 weeks. Compared with routine prenatal care, which required a median of eight visits, the new model required a median of only ive. No disadvantages were attributed to the regimen with fewer visits, and these indings were consistent with other randomized trials (Clement, 1999; McDuie, 1996). At each return visit, the well-being of mother and fetus are assessed (see Table 9-1). Fetal heart rate, growth, and activity and amnionic fluid volume are evaluated. Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks\' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435). Between 20 and 34 weeks\' gestation, the height of the uterine fundus measured in centimeters correlates closely with gestational age in weeks Gimenez, 1983). his measurement is used to monitor fetal growth and amnionic fluid volume. It is measured along the abdominal wall from the top of the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus. Importantly, the bladder must be emptied before fundal measurement (Worthen, 1980). Obesity or the presence of uterine masses such as leiomyomas may also limit fundal height accuracy. Moreover, using fundal height alone, fetal-growth restriction may be undiagnosed in up to a third of cases (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015b; Haragan, 2015). Instruments incorporating Doppler ultrasound are often used to easily detect fetal heart action, and in the absence of maternal obesity, heart sounds are almost always detectable by 10 weeks with such instruments (Chap. 10, p. 213). he fetal heart rate ranges from 11e0 to 160 beats per minute and is typically heard as a double sound. Using a standard nonampliied stethoscope, the fetal heart is audible by 20 weeks in 80 percent of women, and by 22 weeks, heart sounds are expected to be heard in all (Herbert, 1987). Because the fetus moves freely in amni onic fluid, the site on the maternal abdomen where fetal heart sounds can be heard best will vary. Additionally, with ultrasonic auscultation, one may hear the unic soule, which is a sharp, whistling sound that is syn chronous with the fetal pulse. It is caused by the rush of blood through the umbilical arteries and may not be heard consistently. In contrast, the uterine soule is a soft, blowing sound that is synchronous with the maternal pulse. It is produced by the pas sage of blood through the dilated uterine vessels and is heard most distinctly near the lower portion of the uterus. Sonography provides invaluable information regarding fetal anatomy, growth, and well-being, and most women in the United States have at least one prenatal sonographic examination during pregnancy (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016h). Continuing trends suggest that the number of these examinations performed per pregnancy is increasing. Siddique and associates (2009) reported that the average number rose from 1.5 in 1995 through 1997 to 2.7 almost 10 years later. his trend was noted in both high-and low-risk pregnancies.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Strickland OM, HauthJC, WidishJ, et al: Amylase and isoamylase activities in serum of pregnant women.

","['308e) Most patients with disease of the respiratory system undergo imaging of the chest as part of the initial evaluation. Clinicians should generally begin with a plain chest radio-graph, preferably posterior-anterior and lateral films. Several findings, including opacities of the parenchyma, blunting of the costophrenic angles, mass lesions, and volume loss, can be very helpful in determining an etiology. However, many diseases of the respiratory system, particularly those of the airways and pulmonary vasculature, are asso ciated with a normal chest radiograph. CT of the chest is often performed subsequently and allows better delineation of parenchymal processes, pleural disease, masses or nodules, and large airways. If the test includes administration of contrast, the pulmonary vasculature can be assessed with particular utility for determination of pulmonary emboli. Intravenous contrast also allows lymph nodes to be delineated in greater detail. Depending on the clinician’s suspicion, a variety of other studies may be done. Concern about large-airway lesions may warrant bronchoscopy. This procedure may also be used to sample the alveolar space with bronchoalveolar lavage or to obtain nonsurgical lung biopsies. Blood testing may include assessment for hypercoagulable states in the setting of pulmonary vascular disease, serologic testing for infectious or rheumatologic disease, or assessment of inflammatory markers or leukocyte counts (e.g., eosinophils). Sputum evaluation for malignant cells or microorganisms may be appropriate. An echocardiogram to assess rightand left-sided heart function is often obtained. Finally, at times, a surgical lung biopsy is needed to diagnose certain diseases of the respiratory system. All of these studies will be guided by the preceding history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, and chest imaging.

Naureckas, Julian Solway The primary functions of the respiratory system—to oxygenate blood and eliminate carbon dioxide—require virtual contact between blood 306e and fresh air, which facilitates diffusion of respiratory gases between blood and gas. This process occurs in the lung alveoli, where blood flowing through alveolar wall capillaries is separated from alveolar gas by an extremely thin membrane of flattened endothelial and epithelial cells, across which respiratory gases diffuse and equilibrate. Blood flow through the lung is unidirectional via a continuous vascular path, along which venous blood absorbs oxygen from and loses CO2 to inspired gas. The path for airflow, in contrast, reaches a dead end at the alveolar walls; thus the alveolar space must be ventilated tidally, with inflow of fresh gas and outflow of alveolar gas alternating periodically at the respiratory rate (RR). To provide an enormous alveolar surface area (typically 70 m2) for blood-gas diffusion within the modest volume of a thoracic cavity (typically 7 L), nature has distributed both blood flow and ventilation among millions of tiny alveoli through multigenerational branching of both pulmonary arteries and bronchial airways. As a consequence of variations in tube lengths and calibers along these pathways as well as the effects of gravity, tidal pressure fluctuations, and anatomic constraints from the chest wall, the alveoli vary in their relative ventilations and perfusions. Not surprisingly, for the lung to be most efficient in exchanging gas, the fresh gas ventilation of a given alveolus must be matched to its perfusion. For the respiratory system to succeed in oxygenating blood and eliminating CO2, it must be able to ventilate the lung tidally and thus to freshen alveolar gas; it must provide for perfusion of the individual alveolus in a manner proportional to its ventilation; and it must allow adequate diffusion of respiratory gases between alveolar gas and capillary blood. Furthermore, it must accommodate severalfold increases in the demand for oxygen uptake or CO2 elimination imposed by metabolic needs or acid-base derangement. Given these multiple requirements for normal operation, it is not surprising that many diseases disturb respiratory function. This chapter considers in some detail the physiologic determinants of lung ventilation and perfusion, elucidates how the matching distributions of these processes and rapid gas diffusion allow normal gas exchange, and discusses how common diseases derange these normal functions, thereby impairing gas exchange—or at least increasing the work required by the respiratory muscles or heart to maintain adequate respiratory function. It is useful to think about the respiratory system as three independently functioning components: the lung, including its airways; the neuromuscular system; and the chest wall, which includes everything that is not lung or active neuromuscular system. Accordingly, the mass of the respiratory muscles is part of the chest wall, while the force these muscles generate is part of the neuromuscular system; the abdomen (especially an obese abdomen) and the heart (especially an enlarged heart) are, for these purposes, part of the chest wall. Each of these three components has mechanical properties that\n\n\n\nFIguRE 306e-1 Pressure-volume curves of the isolated lung, isolated chest wall, combined respiratory system, inspiratory muscles, and expiratory muscles. FRC, functional residual capacity; RV, residual volume; TLC, total lung capacity. relate to its enclosed volume (or—in the case of the neuromuscular 306e-1 system—the respiratory system volume at which it is operating) and to the rate of change of its volume (i.e., flow). Volume-Related Mechanical Properties—Statics Figure 306e-1 shows the volume-related properties of each component of the respiratory system. Due both to surface tension at the air-liquid interface between alveolar wall lining fluid and alveolar gas and to elastic recoil of the lung tissue itself, the lung requires a positive transmural pressure difference between alveolar gas and its pleural surface to stay inflated; this difference is called the elastic recoil pressure of the lung, and it increases with lung volume. The lung becomes rather stiff at high volumes, so that relatively small volume changes are accompanied by large changes in transpulmonary pressure; in contrast, the lung is compliant at lower volumes, including those at which tidal breathing normally occurs. At zero inflation pressure, even normal lungs retain some air in the alveoli because the small peripheral airways are tethered open by radially outward pull from inflated lung parenchyma attached to adventitia; as the lung deflates during exhalation, those small airways are pulled open progressively less, and eventually they close, trapping some gas in the alveoli. This effect can be exaggerated with age and especially with obstructive airway diseases, resulting in gas trapping at quite large lung volumes. The elastic behavior of the passive chest wall (i.e., in the absence of neuromuscular activation) differs markedly from that of the lung. Whereas the lung tends toward full deflation with no distending (transmural) pressure, the chest wall encloses a large volume when pleural pressure equals body surface (atmospheric) pressure. Furthermore, the chest wall is compliant at high enclosed volumes, readily expanding even further in response to increases in transmural pressure. The chest wall also remains compliant at small negative transmural pressures (i.e., when pleural pressure falls slightly below atmospheric pressure), but as the volume enclosed by the chest wall becomes quite small in response to large negative transmural pressures, the passive chest wall becomes stiff due to squeezing together of ribs and intercostal muscles, diaphragm stretch, displacement of abdominal contents, and straining of ligaments and bony articulations. Under normal circumstances, the lung and the passive chest wall enclose essentially the same volume, the only difference being the volumes of the pleural fluid and of the lung parenchyma (both quite small). For this reason and because the lung and chest wall function in mechanical series, the pressure required to displace the passive respiratory system (lungs plus chest wall) at any volume is simply the sum of the elastic recoil pressure of the lungs and the transmural pressure across the chest wall. When plotted against respiratory system volume, this relationship assumes a sigmoid shape, exhibiting stiffness at high lung volumes (imparted by the lung), stiffness at low lung volumes (imparted by the chest wall or sometimes by airway closure), and compliance in the middle range of lung volumes. CHAPTER 306e Disturbances of Respiratory Function\n\n\n\nFIguRE 306e-2 Spirogram demonstrating a slow vital capacity maneuver and various lung volumes. In addition, a passive resting point of the respiratory system is attained when alveolar gas pressure equals body surface pressure (i.e., when the transrespiratory system pressure is zero). At this volume (called the functional residual capacity [FRC]), the outward recoil of the chest wall is balanced exactly by the inward recoil of the lung. As these recoils are transmitted through the pleural fluid, the lung is pulled both outward and inward simultaneously at FRC, and thus its pressure falls below atmospheric pressure (typically, −5 cmH2O). The normal passive respiratory system would equilibrate at the FRC and remain there were it not for the actions of respiratory muscles. The inspiratory muscles act on the chest wall to generate the equivalent of positive pressure across the lungs and passive chest wall, while the expiratory muscles generate the equivalent of negative transrespiratory pressure. The maximal pressures these sets of muscles can generate vary with the lung volume at which they operate. This variation is due to length-tension relationships in striated muscle sarcomeres and to changes in mechanical advantage as the angles of insertion change with lung volume (Fig. 306e-1). Nonetheless, under normal conditions, the respiratory muscles are substantially “overpowered” for their roles and generate more than adequate force to drive the respiratory system to its stiffness extremes, as determined by the lung (total lung capacity [TLC]) or by chest wall or airway closure (residual volume [RV]); the airway closure always prevents the adult lung from emptying completely under normal circumstances. The excursion between full and minimal lung inflation is called vital capacity (VC; Fig. 306e-2) and is readily seen to be the difference between volumes at two unrelated stiffness extremes—one determined by the lung (TLC) and the other by the chest wall or airways (RV). Thus, although VC is easy to measure (see below), it provides little information about the intrinsic properties of the respiratory system. As will become clear, it is much more useful for the clinician to consider TLC and RV individually. Flow-Related Mechanical Properties—Dynamics The passive chest wall and active neuromuscular system do exhibit mechanical behaviors related to the rate of change of volume, but these behaviors become quantitatively important only at markedly supraphysiologic breathing frequencies (e.g., during high-frequency mechanical ventilation) and thus will not be addressed here. In contrast, the dynamic airflow properties of the lung substantially affect its ability to ventilate and contribute importantly to the work of breathing, and these properties are often deranged by disease. Understanding dynamic airflow properties is therefore worthwhile. As with the flow of any fluid (gas or liquid) in any tube, maintenance of airflow within the pulmonary airways requires a pressure gradient that falls along the direction of flow, the magnitude of which is determined by the flow rate and the frictional resistance to flow. During quiet tidal breathing, the pressure gradients driving inspiratory or expiratory flow are small owing to the very low frictional resistance of normal pulmonary airways (Raw, normally <2 cmH2O/L per second). However, during rapid exhalation, another phenomenon reduces flow below that which would have been expected if frictional resistance were the only impediment to flow. This phenomenon is called dynamic\n\n\n\nFIguRE 306e-3 Luminal area versus transmural pressure relationship. Transmural pressure represents the pressure difference across the airway wall from inside to outside. airflow limitation, and it occurs because the bronchial airways through which air is exhaled are collapsible rather than rigid (Fig.', 'Mary Strek and Jeffrey Jacobson. CHAPTER 306e Disturbances of Respiratory Function\n\n\n\nDiagnostic procedures in respiratory Disease Anne L. Fuhlbrigge, Augustine M. K. Choi The diagnostic modalities available for assessing the patient with suspected or known respiratory system disease include imaging stud-307 ies and techniques for acquiring biologic specimens, some of which involve direct visualization of part of the respiratory system. Methods to characterize the functional changes developing as a result of disease, including pulmonary function tests and measurements of gas exchange, are discussed in Chap. 306e. Routine chest radiography, including both posteroanterior (PA) and lateral views, is an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation of diseases involving the pulmonary parenchyma, the pleura, and, to a lesser extent, the airways and the mediastinum (see Chaps. 305 and 308e). Lateral decubitus views are useful for determining whether pleural abnormalities represent freely flowing fluid, whereas apical lordotic views can visualize disease at the lung apices better than the standard PA view. Portable equipment is often used for acutely ill patients who cannot be transported to a radiology suite but are more difficult to interpret owing to several limitations: (1) the single anteroposterior (AP) projection obtained; (2) variability in overand underexposure of film; (3) a shorter focal spot-film distance leading to lack of edge sharpness and loss of fine detail; and (4) magnification of the cardiac silhouette and other anterior structures by the AP projection.

New York, McGraw-Hili, 2012.) review, Hillman and colleagues (2013) identified copy number variants of uncertain significance in 1 to 2 percent of prenatal specimens. Not unexpectedly, this may be a source of signiicant distress to families, even with comprehensive pretest counseling. In pregnancies at increased risk for autosomal trisomy based on aneuploidy screening, karyotyping or FISH plus karyotyping should be ofered, and CMA should be made available (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016b). When the karyotype is normal, CMA has identiied clinically relevant copy number variants in approximately 6.5 percent of pregnancies with fetal abnormalities and in 1 to 2 percent with no obvious fetal abnormality (Callaway, 2013). he American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016b) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (2016) recommend that CMA be ofered as a irst-tier test when fetal structural abnormalities are identiied, replacing fetal karyotyping in these cases. If a particular anomaly that strongly suggests a speciic aneuploidy is identiied, such as an endocardial cushion defect (trisomy 21) or alobar holoprosencephaly (trisomy 13), karyotyping or FISH may be ofered as the initial test. It is recommended that genetic counseling include information about the beneits and limitations of both CMA and karyotyping, and that each be made available to women who elect prenatal diagnosis (Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 2016). CMA may identiy instances of autosomal dominant genetic disorders that have not yet manifested in an afected parent, and it may also identiy instances of nonpaternity. For stillbirth evaluation, CMA is more likely than standard karyotyping to provide a genetic diagnosis, in part because it does not require dividing cells. he Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network found that when karyotyping was uninformative, approximately 6 percent of cases had either aneuploidy or a pathogenic copy number variant identiied with CMA (Reddy, 2012). Overall, CMA yields results nearly 25 percent more often than standard karyotyping alone. Most fetuses with structural abnormalities have a normal karyotype and a normal CMA result. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a technique for analyzing the entire genome. Whole exome sequencing (WES) analyzes just the DNA coding regions, which account for approximately 1 percent of the genome. These next-generation sequencing tools are increasingly used in the postnatal setting to evaluate suspected genetic syndromes and intellectual disability. The American College of Medical Genetics Board of Directors (2012) states that WGS and WES may be considered for evaluation of the fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which CMA has failed to arrive at a diagnosis. The American College of 0bstetricians and Gynecologists (201i6a) suggests that this be in only selected circumstances, for example, with recurrent or lethal anomalies in which other approaches have been noninformative. Importantly, WGS and WES have signiicant limitations in their current form, including turnaround times that may be prohibitively long and a high rate of variants of uncertain signiicance (American College of �1edical Genetics, 2012; Atwal, 2014). As a result, the clinical utility of this promising technology for prenatal cases is currently limited. • Fetal DNA in the Maternal Circulation Fetal cells are present in maternal blood at a very low concentration, only 2 to 6 cells per milliliter (Bianchi, 2006). Sometimes, intact fetal cells may persist in the maternal circulation for decades following delivery. Persistent fetal cells may engraft in the mother and result in microchimerism, which has been implicated in maternal autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. For prenatal diagnosis, the use of intact fetal cells from maternal blood is limited by low cell concentration, cell persistence into successive pregnancies, and diiculties in distinguishing fetal from maternal cells. In these cases, however, cell-free DNA overcomes these limitations. Cell-Free DNA hese DNA fragments are derived from maternal cells and from apoptotic placental trophoblast cells-although DNA from the latter is often termed ""fetal."" Cell-free DNA can be reliably genotyping Maternal Real-time quantitative PCR Detection of single-gene disorders Genetics 273 detected in maternal blood after 9 to 10 weeks\' gestation (American College of 0bstetricians and Gynecologists, 20 17b). he proportion of cell-free DNA that is placental is called the fetal fraction, and it composes approximately 10 percent of the total circulating cell-free DNA in maternal plasma. Unlike intact fetal cells, cell-free DNA is cleared within minutes from maternal blood. In research settings, cell-free DNA has been used to detect numerous single-gene disorders transmitted through paternally inherited alleles. These include myotonic dystrophy, achondroplasia, Huntington disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cystic fibrosis, and a-thalassemia (Wright, 2009). Clinical applications of cell-free DNA are aneuploidy screening, fetal sex determination, and h D genotyping (Fig. 13-14). Aneuploidy Screening. Several diferent types of assays are used to screen for fetal autosomal trisomies and sex chromosomal aneuploidies. hese include whole-genome sequencing, which is also called massively parallel or shotgun sequencing; chromosome selective or targeted sequencing; and analysis of SNPs (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016a,b). By simultaneously sequencing millions of DNA fragments, investigators can identiy whether the proportion or ratio of fragments from one chromosome is higher than expected. Sequences of fetal DNA are specific to individual chromosomes. hus, samples from women with a Down syndrome fetus have a larger proportion of DNA sequences from chromosome 21. The screening performance of cell-free DNA is excellent. In a metaanalysis of 37 studies of largely high-risk pregnancies, the pooled sensitivity to detect Down syndrome was 99 percent, and to identiy trisomies 18 and 13, 96 and 91 percent, respectively. For each, the speciicity was 99.9 percent (Gil, 2015).', '3. B. Without any rudimentary horn\n\n\n\nClass III. Uterus didelphys\n\n\n\nClass IV. Bicornuate uterus\n\n\n\nA.

Regardless of the karyotype, the individual with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism has some form of ovarian “failure” (i.e., primary hypogonadism). Forms of Gonadal Failure Turner Syndrome The diagnosis of Turner syndrome requires the presence of characteristic features in phenotypic females coupled with complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome, with or without cell line mosaicism. Most affected individuals have a 45,X karyotype, while others have mosaic karyotypes (i.e., 45,X/46,XX; 45,X/46,XY). Intrauterine growth restriction is common in infants with a 45,X karyotype. After birth, these patients generally grow slowly, beginning in the second or third year of life. They typically have many of the associated stigmata, including lymphedema and sometimes large cystic hygromas of the neck at birth; a webbed neck; multiple pigmented nevi; disorders of the heart, kidneys (most commonly horseshoe), and great vessels (most commonly coarctation of the aorta); and small hyperconvex fingernails (35) (Fig. 29.10). Diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, essential hypertension, and other autoimmune disorders are often present in individuals with 45,X karyotypes. Most 45,X patients have normal intelligence, but many affected individuals have an unusual cognitive defect characterized by an inability to appreciate the shapes and relations of objects with respect to one another (i.e., space-form blindness). Patients with a small ring X chromosome have an increased risk of mental retardation (36). As they grow older, affected children typically are shorter than normal. Although they do not develop breasts at puberty, some pubic or axillary hair may develop because appropriate adrenarche can occur with failure of thelarche (i.e., breast development). Figure 29.10 Typical appearance of two individuals with 45,X gonadal dysgenesis. A: This 16-year-old individual has obvious short stature, a webbed neck, shortened fourth metatarsals, and a thoracotomy scar from the repair of the coarctation of the aorta that was performed at 13 years of age. B: This 11-year-old individual also has obvious short stature and stigmata of Turner syndrome. Note that these two individuals look more like each other than they might look like any genetic siblings. Although less severe short stature and some adolescent development may occur with chromosomal mosaicism, it is reasonable to assume that any short, slowly growing, sexually infantile girl has Turner syndrome until proved otherwise because this disorder is so prevalent (about 1 in 2,500 newborn phenotypic females). In fact, the 45,X karyotype is the single most frequent chromosomal disorder in humans, but most affected fetuses are aborted spontaneously early in pregnancy. However, trisomy is the most common chromosomal type or category of abnormality in first-trimester losses. The short stature commonly associated with the Turner phenotype appears to result from the loss of a homeobox-containing gene (which encodes for an osteogenic gene) located on the pseudoautosomal region (PAR 1) of the short arms of the X (Xp22) and Y (Yp11.3) chromosomes (37). This gene, which is called either SHOX (short stature homeobox-containing gene) or PHOG (pseudoautosomal homeobox osteogenic gene), escapes X inactivation because of its pseudoautosomal location. The gene appears to account for about two-thirds of the height deficit commonly associated with Turner syndrome. Even in the presence of typical Turner stigmata, a karyotype is indicated to eliminate the possibility of the presence of any portion of a Y chromosome. Analysis of pooled data suggests that the presence of Y chromosome material is associated with a 12% risk of a gonadoblastoma (38). If a Y chromosome is identified, laparoscopic prophylactic gonadectomy is recommended at the time of diagnosis to eliminate the risk of malignancy. Although gonadoblastomas are benign tumors with no metastatic potential that can arise spontaneously in gonads containing a portion of a Y chromosome, they can be precursors to germ cell malignancies, such as dysgerminomas (most commonly), teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, or endodermal sinus tumors (39). In individuals in whom there is no evidence of neoplastic dissemination, the uterus may be left in situ for donor in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. Individuals with Turner syndrome are at increased risk of sudden death from aortic rupture or dissection resulting from cystic medial necrosis during pregnancy, and the risk may be as great as 2% or more (40). In addition, this may occur even if the aortic root diameter is normal. Because of their small stature, ascending aortic diameters of less than 5 cm may represent significant dilatation. Thus, the use of the aortic size index (ascending aortic diameters measured by MRI at the level of the right pulmonary artery normalized to body surface area) is preferred (41). Patients with an aortic size index greater than 2.0 cm/m2 require close cardiovascular surveillance and those with an aortic size index of 2.5 cm/m2 or more are at highest risk for aortic dissection. In fact, the risk of acute aortic dissection is increased by more than 100-fold in young and middle-aged women with Turner syndrome. If pregnancy is being considered, preconception assessment must include cardiologic evaluation with MRI of the aorta. The evaluation of other commonly involved organ systems should include a careful physical examination, with special attention to the cardiovascular system, and thyroid function tests (including antibody assessment), fasting blood glucose, renal function tests, and intravenous pyelography or a renal ultrasonography. Treatment of Turner Syndrome To increase final adult height, commonly accepted treatment strategies include use of exogenous GH (42–44). With recombinant human GH use, the average height gain varied from 4 to 16 cm. It appears that early initiation of therapy (between 2–8 years of age), gradually increasing the dose, and continuing treatment for a mean of 7 years can lead to achievement of a final height greater than 150 cm in most patients (43). Weekly doses of GH of 0.375 mg/kg divided into seven daily doses are typical. Therapy may be continued until a satisfactory height is attained or until little growth potential remains (bone age ≥14 years and growth velocity <2 cm per year). It is not clear if a nonaromatizable anabolic steroid such as oxandrolone will provide additional growth. In girls older than 8 years of age or those with extreme short stature, consideration can be given to using higher doses of GH and adding oxandrolone (45). The dose of oxandrolone should be 0.05 mg/kg per day or less, as higher doses will result in virilization and more rapid skeletal maturation. In addition, liver enzymes should be monitored. The gonadal steroid treatment of patients with Turner syndrome is as follows: 1. To promote sexual maturation, therapy with exogenous estrogen should be initiated when the patient is psychologically ready, at about 12 to 13 years of age, and after GH therapy was administered for several years. Low-dose estrogen can be introduced at this time without compromising final adult height (46). 2. Because the intent is to mimic normal pubertal development, therapy with low-dose estrogen alone (such as 0.025 mg per day transdermal estradiol or 0.3–0.625 mg conjugated estrogens orally each day) should be initiated. 3. Progestins (5–10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate or 200 mg micronized progesterone orally for 12 to 14 days every 1 to 2 months) can be added to prevent endometrial hyperplasia after the patient first experiences vaginal bleeding or after 6 to 12 months of unopposed estrogen use if the patient has not yet had any bleeding. 4. The dose of estrogen is increased slowly over 1 to 2 years until the patient is taking about twice as much estrogen as the amount administered to postmenopausal women. 5. Girls with gonadal dysgenesis must be monitored carefully for the development of hypertension with estrogen therapy. 6. The patients and their parents should be counseled regarding the emotional and physical changes that will occur with therapy. 7. It is important to educate the patient that hormone replacement therapy is usually required until the time of normal menopause to maintain feminization and prevent osteoporosis (47). Mosaic Forms of Gonadal Dysgenesis Individuals with rare mosaic forms of gonadal dysgenesis may develop normally at puberty. The decision to initiate therapy with exogenous estrogen should be based mainly on circulating FSH levels. Levels in the normal range for the patient’s age imply the presence of functional gonads. These individuals can become pregnant, with success rates of more than 50% using donor oocytes (48). The increased risk of sudden death during pregnancy resulting from aortic rupture should be assumed to be similar to that of other women with the Turner phenotype (40). Pure Gonadal Dysgenesis The term pure gonadal dysgenesis refers to 46,XX or 46,XY phenotypic females who have streak gonads. This condition may occur sporadically or may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait or as an X-linked trait in XY gonadal dysgenesis (Fig. 29.11). Affected girls typically are of average height and have none of the stigmata of Turner syndrome, but they have elevated levels of FSH because the streak gonads produce neither steroid hormones nor inhibin. When gonadal dysgenesis occurs in 46,XY individuals, it is sometimes termed Swyer syndrome. Surgical extirpation is warranted in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype to prevent development of germ cell neoplasms. Both 46,XX and 46,XY forms of gonadal dysgenesis benefit from exogenous estrogen and are potential candidates for donor oocytes. In early gonadal failure, the ovaries apparently develop normally but contain no oocytes by the expected age of puberty. These disorders are considered further in the discussion delineating the evaluation of amenorrhea (see Chapter 30). Hypothalamic–pituitary disturbances are usually associated with low levels of circulating gonadotropins (with both LH and FSH levels less than or equal to 10 mIU/mL) (49). There are both sporadic and familial causes of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and the differential diagnosis is extensive. Mutations in several genes cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in humans (50). This condition can arise from abnormalities in hypothalamic GnRH secretion, impaired release of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland, or both. At least 17 different single-gene mutations are identified as being associated with delayed or absent puberty in humans (51). They are estimated to account for about 30% of individuals with disorders of puberty. These genes include KAL1 (X-linked Kallmann syndrome), FGFR1 (autosomal Kallmann syndrome), DAX1 (the gene for X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia), GNRHR (the gene for the GnRH receptor), PC1 (the gene for prohormone convertase 1), and GPR54 (encoding a G-protein coupled receptor). Delayed puberty may result from mutations in genes affecting gonadotrophs specifically (GnRHR, LHβ, FSHβ) or in genes involved more generally in the development and functioning of the pituitary gland (LHX3, PROP1, HESX1). Constitutional Delay It is important to remember that low levels of LH and FSH are normally present in the prepubertal years; thus, girls with constitutionally delayed puberty may mistakenly be presumed to have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Constitutional delay is the most common cause of delayed puberty. In a normal population, 2% to 3% of normal children will be classified as having pubertal delay, and this finding may be considered a normal variant. Constitutional delayed growth and adolescence can be diagnosed only after careful evaluation excludes other causes of delayed puberty and normal sexual development is documented by longitudinal follow-up. The farther below the third percentile for height that the young girl is, the less likely it is that the cause is constitutional. Because some children are severely handicapped socially by constitutional pubertal delay, some physicians occasionally provide exogenous estrogen in low doses for 3 to 4 months to stimulate some pubertal development. However, the benefits of treatment are not well documented, and there is little evidence to support the idea that treatment improves psychosocial function. Kallmann Syndrome As originally described in 1944, Kallmann syndrome consisted of the triad of anosmia, hypogonadism, and color blindness in men (52). Women may be affected, and other associated defects may include cleft lip and palate, cerebellar ataxia, nerve deafness, and abnormalities of thirst and vasopressin release. The frequency approximates\n\n\n\nFigure 29.11 A: A 16-year-old individual with 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis and primary amenorrhea. Circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were markedly elevated. The small amount of breast development (Tanner stage 2) is unusual, but some pubertal development may occur in such patients. 1 in 10,000 men and 1 in 50,000 women. Sporadic cases are more common than inherited forms. Inheritance is described as being X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive. Because autopsy studies show partial or complete agenesis of the olfactory bulb, the term olfactogenital dysplasia is used to describe the disorder. These anatomic findings coincide with embryologic studies documenting that GnRH neurons originally develop in the epithelium of the olfactory placode and normally migrate into the hypothalamus (53). In some affected individuals, gene defects were found in one protein, anosmin-1, that facilitates this neuronal migration, thus leading to an absence of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus and olfactory bulbs and consequent hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia (Kallmann syndrome) (54). The gene defect resulting in loss of this adhesion protein is localized to the Xp22.3\n\n\n\nFigure 29.11 (Continued ) B: A 16-year-old individual with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis who presented with primary amenorrhea and markedly elevated FSH levels.

Other features of X-linked Kallmann syndrome include unilateral renal agenesis, bimanual synkinesia, and sensorineural hearing loss. In some cases of autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome, inactivating mutations of the gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1 or KAL2) were reported. The disorder is so heterogeneous that it appears likely that it forms a structural continuum with other midline defects. Septo-optic dysplasia represents the most severe form of the disorder. Clinically, affected individuals typically present with sexual infantilism and an eunuchoid habitus, but some degree of breast development may occur (Fig. 29.12). Primary amenorrhea is the rule. The ovaries are usually small, with follicles seldom developing beyond the primordial stage. Circulating gonadotropin levels are usually very low but almost invariably measurable. Affected individuals respond readily to pulsatile administration of exogenous GnRH, and this is the most physiologic approach to ovulation induction (48). For women not seeking pregnancy, therapy with exogenous estrogen and progestin is indicated. Isolated gonadotropin deficiency can occur in association with the Prader-Labhart-Willi syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, short stature, hypogonadism, small hands and feet (acromicria), mental retardation, and infantile hypotonia. When the syndrome occurs in association with the Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, postaxial polydactyly, obesity, and hypogonadism may be present. Prader-Labhart-Willi syndrome apparently results from rearrangements of chromosome 15q11 to q13, an imprinted region of the human genome (55). Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, is apparently heterogeneous, with at least four involved gene loci having been mapped to date (56). Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, which are usually hypothalamic in origin, may be congenital and either part of an inherited constellation of findings or sporadic. IfGH or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations are subnormal, growth and pubertal development will be affected. Thus, the condition should be diagnosed before the age of puberty. Because individuals with hypopituitarism have a high mortality rate, predominantly caused by vascular and respiratory disease, it is important to identify affected individuals. Later age at diagnosis, female sex, and above all craniopharyngioma are identified as significant independent risk factors (57). Untreated gonadotropin deficiency is an important risk factor for early mortality. Tumors of the Hypothalamus and Pituitary Several different tumors of the hypothalamic and pituitary regions may lead to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (58) (Fig. 29.13A). Except for craniopharyngiomas, these tumors are relatively uncommon in children. A craniopharyngioma is a tumor of the Rathke’s pouch. It is the most common neoplasm associated with delayed puberty, and it accounts for 10% of all childhood central nervous system tumors. Craniopharyngiomas are usually suprasellar in location and may be asymptomatic well into the second decade of life. Such tumors may present as headache, visual disturbances, short stature or growth failure, delayed puberty, or diabetes insipidus. Visual field defects (including bilateral temporal hemianopsia), optic atrophy, or papilledema may be seen on physical examination. Laboratory evaluation should document hypogonadotropism and may reveal hyperprolactinemia as a result of interruption of hypothalamic dopamine inhibition of prolactin release. Radiographically, the tumor may be either cystic or solid and may show areas of calcification. Appropriate therapy for hypothalamic–pituitary tumors may involve surgical excision or radiotherapy (with adequate pituitary hormone replacement therapy) and are best managed by a team of physicians that includes an endocrinologist, a neurosurgeon, and a radiotherapist. Other Central Nervous System Disorders Other central nervous system disorders that may lead to delayed puberty include infiltrative diseases, such as Langerhans cell-type histiocytosis, particularly the form known previously as Hand-Sch¨uller-Christian disease (Fig. 29.13B and 29.13C). Diabetes insipidus is the most common endocrinopathy (because of infiltration of the supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus), but short stature resulting from GH deficiency and delayed puberty caused by gonadotropin deficiency are not uncommon in this disorder (59). Irradiation of the central nervous system for treatment of any neoplasm or leukemia may result in hypothalamic dysfunction. Although GH deficiency is the most frequent finding, partial or complete gonadotropin deficiency may develop in some patients. Figure 29.12 Left A 21.-year-old woman with Kallmann syndrome. Note that the patient has some pubic and axillary hair. Bone age was 16 years. It is rare to see affected individuals today who were not given oral contraceptive agents to induce menses (with some consequent breast development). (From Wilkins L. The diagnosis and treatment of endocrine disorders in childhood and adolescence. 3rd ed. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas, 1965, with permission.)\n\n\n\nFigure 29.13 Right A: A 16-year-old girl with delayed puberty. Breast budding began at 11 years of age, but there was no further development. During the year before presentation, her scholastic performance in school deteriorated, she gained 25 lb, she became increasingly lethargic, and nocturia and polydypsia were noted. Initial evaluation documented low follicle-stimulating hormone, elevated prolactin, and a bone age of 10.5 years. Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development. (From Rebar RW. Normal and abnormal sexual differentiation and pubertal development. In: Moore TR, Reiter RC, Rebar RW, et al., eds. Gynecology and obstetrics: a longitudinal approach. New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1993:97–133, with permission.)\n\n\n\nSevere chronic illnesses, often accompanied by malnutrition, may lead to slowed growth in childhood and delayed adolescence. Regardless of the cause, weight loss to less than 80% to 85% of ideal body weight often results in hypothalamic GnRH deficiency. If adequate body weight and nutrition are maintained in chronic illnesses such as Crohn disease or chronic pulmonary or renal disease, sufficient gonadotropin secretion usually is present to initiate and maintain pubertal development. Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Significant weight loss and psychological dysfunction occur simultaneously with anorexia nervosa (60,61). Although many anorectic girls experience amenorrhea after pubertal development begins, if the disorder begins sufficiently early,\n\n\n\nFigure 29.13 B: A 16-year-old girl (frontal view) with primary amenorrhea who progressed in puberty until about 12 years of age. Breast budding occurred at about 10 years of age. The patient’s short stature is obvious. She proved to have hypopituitarism. Classic radiographic findings established the diagnosis of Langerhans cell–type histiocytosis (Hand-Sch¨ uller-Christian disease). C: Side view of girl shown in Figure 29.13B. pubertal development may be delayed or interrupted (Fig. 29.14). The following constellation of associated findings confirms anorexia nervosa in most individuals: 1. Relentless pursuit of thinness 2. Amenorrhea, sometimes preceding the weight loss 3. 4. 5. Distorted and bizarre attitude toward eating, food, or weight 6. Because normal body weight is commonly maintained in bulimia, it is unusual for bulimic patients to experience either delayed development or amenorrhea. Girls with anorexia nervosa may have, in addition to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, partial diabetes insipidus, abnormal temperature regulation, hypotension, chemical hypothyroidism with low serum triiodothyronine (T3) and high reverse T3 levels, and elevated circulating cortisol levels in the absence of evidence of hypercortisolism (62). Other common features include hypokalemia, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, high β-carotene levels, and high cholesterol levels. All features of anorexia nervosa are reversible with weight gain, except for amenorrhea (which persists in 30% to 47%) and osteopenia (i.e., it now seems that any bone lost cannot be fully recovered). Management of patients with anorexia nervosa is notoriously difficult. A team approach involving the primary clinician, psychiatrist, and nutritionist is most effective. In fact, anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality of any psychiatric disorder. Deaths are often sudden and unexpected. Cause of death (often unknown) can include hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance. Figure 29.14 A: A 20-year-old college woman with anorexia nervosa. B: A 16-year-old student with anorexia nervosa. In both cases, as is true of most such patients, pubertal development had been completed and menses initiated before anorexia led to marked weight loss. Fear of obesity, a syndrome of self-induced malnutrition common among teenage gymnasts and ballet dancers, may slow growth and delay pubertal development (63). These children voluntarily reduce their caloric intake as much as 40%, leading to nutritional growth retardation. An additive role for endurance training in the delayed development is possible, but the mechanisms are unclear at this point. These conditions are essentially severe forms of hypothalamic amenorrhea. Inevitably delayed puberty will occur unless adequate caloric intake is provided. Hyperprolactinemia Low levels of LH and FSH may be associated with hyperprolactinemia. As noted, galactorrhea cannot occur in the absence of complete breast development. Pituitary prolactinomas are rare during adolescence but must be considered when certain signs and symptoms are present. Many individuals with prolactinomas have a history of delayed menarche. The association between the ingestion of certain drugs (most often psychotropic agents and opiates in this age group) is well established. Primary hypothyroidism is associated with hyperprolactinemia because increased levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulate secretion of prolactin. The empty sella syndrome, in which the sella turcica is enlarged but is replaced by cerebrospinal ﬂuid, may be associated with hyperprolactinemia. Use of Chemotherapeutic Agents As survival rates following treatment for childhood malignancy improve, the effects of cancer therapy become more important. Both radiation therapy to the abdomen and systemic chemotherapeutic agents, particularly alkylating agents, have toxic effects on germ cells. Although prepubertal gonads appear less vulnerable than those of adults, ovarian failure is common. An argument can be made for endocrine assessment as early as 1 year following completion of therapy to identify children who will suffer from hypogonadism. Spontaneous ovarian activity can resume even years after therapy. Asynchronous Puberty Asynchronous pubertal development is characteristic of androgen insensitivity (i.e., testicular feminization). Affected individuals typically present with breast development (usually only to Tanner stage 3) out of proportion with the amount of pubic and axillary hair present (Fig. 29.15). In this disorder, 46,XY individuals have bilateral testes, female external genitalia, a blindly ending vagina (often foreshortened and sometimes absent), and no m¨ullerian derivatives (i.e., uterus and fallopian tubes) (64). Infrequently, patients may have clitoral enlargement and labioscrotal fusion at puberty, which is referred to as incomplete androgen insensitivity. Asynchronous puberty is heterogeneous but is always related to some abnormality of the androgen receptor or of androgen action (65). In perhaps 60% to 70% of cases, androgen receptors cannot be detected (i.e., the patient is receptor negative). In the remaining cases, androgen receptors are present (i.e., receptor positive), but mutations in the androgen receptor are detected or there is a defect at a more distal step in androgen action (i.e., a postreceptor defect). Receptor-positive individuals are indistinguishable clinically from receptor-negative individuals. Several different mutations in the androgen receptor gene, most of which occur within the androgen-binding domain of the receptor, are identified in affected individuals who are receptor positive. Severe X-linked androgen receptor gene mutations cause complete androgen insensitivity, whereas mild mutations impair virilization with or without infertility, and moderate mutations result in a wide phenotypic spectrum of expression among siblings (66). Because the Sertoli cells of the testes make antim¨ullerian hormone (AMH), m¨ullerian derivatives are absent in this disorder; thus, m¨ullerian regression occurs normally. The testes are often normal in size and may be located anywhere along the path of embryonic testicular descent—in the abdomen, inguinal canal, or labia. Half of all individuals with androgen insensitivity develop inguinal hernias. Recognizing that most such girls will be 46,XX, it is important to determine the karyotype in prepubertal girls with inguinal hernias, especially if a uterus cannot be detected with certainty by ultrasound. The risk of germ cell malignancy is 2% in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (67). Most clinicians believe the risk for gonadal neoplasia is low before 25 years of age; thus, the testes should be left in place until after pubertal feminization, especially because the risk of neoplasia appears to increase with age. Exogenous estrogen should be provided after gonadectomy. The diagnosis is often suspected by the typical physical findings and strongly suggested by normal (or even somewhat elevated) male levels of testosterone, normal or somewhat elevated levels of LH, and normal levels of FSH. The diagnosis is confirmed by a 46,XY karyotype. Interacting with the patient and family requires sensitivity and care. It may be inadvisable to begin by informing the patient of the karyotype; the psychological implications may be devastating because the patient was reared as a girl. Family members should be informed initially that m¨ullerian aplasia occurred and that the risk for neoplasia mandates gonadectomy after puberty. Because the disorder can be inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion, families should undergo appropriate genetic counseling and screening to identify the possible existence of other affected family members. Precocious Puberty Although precocious pubertal development may be classified in several ways, it is perhaps simplest to think of the development as gonadotropin dependent (in which case it is almost invariably of central origin) or gonadotropin independent (of peripheral origin). Precocious puberty is 20 times more common in girls than in boys. In fully 90% of girls, the precocious development is idiopathic, whereas this appears to be true for only 10% of boys. Family history, the rapidity with which secondary sexual characteristics are developing, the rate of growth, and the presence or absence of central nervous system disease should all be considered\n\n\n\nFigure 29.15 A: This 17-year-old individual presented with primary amenorrhea and was found to have a blind-ending vagina and bilateral inguinal masses.

New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1993:97–133, with permission.) in deciding whether to pursue evaluation of a girl for precocious puberty. The evaluation of precocious puberty is as follows: 1. Measurement of basal gonadotropin levels is the first step in the evaluation of a child with sexual precocity (Fig. 29.16). 2. Thyroid function should be evaluated to rule out primary hypothyroidism as the cause of precocious development. 3. High levels of LH (which really may be human chorionic gonadotropin detected because of cross-reactivity with LH in immunoassays) suggest a gonadotropinproducing neoplasm, most often a pinealoma (ectopic germinoma) or choriocarcinoma or, less often, a hepatoblastoma. (Gonadotropin-producing neoplasms are the only causes of precocious puberty in which the gonadotropin dependence does not equate with central precocious puberty.) 4. Low or pubertal levels of gonadotropins indicate the need to determine circulating estradiol concentrations in girls with isosexual development and to assess androgen levels, specifically testosterone, DHEAS, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in girls with heterosexual development. 5. Increased estradiol levels suggest an estrogen-secreting neoplasm, probably of ovarian origin. 6. Increased testosterone levels suggest an androgen-producing neoplasm of the ovary or the adrenal gland. Such neoplasms may be palpable on abdominal or rectal exam ination. Increased 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels are diagnostic of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (i.e., congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH]). Levels of DHEAS are elevated in various forms of CAH. 7. If the estradiol levels are compatible with the degree of pubertal development observed, evaluation of the central nervous system by MRI or CT scanning is warranted. 8. Bone age should always be assessed in evaluating an individual with sexual precocity. 9. A GnRH stimulation test can be used to confirm central precocious puberty. After 100 μg GnRH, an LH peak of greater than 15 mIU/mL is suggestive of gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty (68). Perhaps the most difficult decision for the gynecologist is determining how much evaluation is warranted for the young girl brought in by her mother for precocious breast budding only (precocious thelarche) or the appearance of pubic or axillary hair alone (precocious pubarche or adrenarche) (Fig. 29.17). In such cases, it is acceptable to many clinicians to follow the patient at frequent intervals and to proceed with evaluation if there is evidence of pubertal progression. The feasibility of this approach may depend on the concerns of the parents. Premature Thelarche Premature thelarche is unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement without other signs of sexual maturation. There is no significant nipple or areola development. It usually occurs by 2 years of age and rarely after age 4. It may be caused by increased sensitivity of the breasts to low levels of estrogen or to increased estradiol secretion by follicular cysts. It is a benign self-limited disorder and thus only reassurance and follow-up are required. In most cases, onset of puberty, adult height, and adult reproductive function are normal (69). Rarely, premature thelarche can be a harbinger of progressive gonadarche. It is suggested that measurement of uterine volume (anteroposterior diameter × longitudinal diameter × transverse diameter × 0.523) may be the most sensitive and specific discriminator between premature thelarche and early true precocious puberty (70). If needed, breast ultrasound can help distinguish unilateral premature thelarche from fibroadenomas, cysts, neurofibromas, or other lesions. Premature Adrenarche Premature adrenarche or pubarche may be caused by increased sensitivity to low levels of androgens and must be distinguished from late-onset (nonclassic) CAH. If there is no evidence of breast development or of progression, these conditions are virtually always benign. Girls with premature adrenarche are at increased risk of developing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperinsulinemia, acanthosis nigricans, and dyslipidemia in adolescence and adult life, especially if fetal growth was reduced and birth weight was low (71). Although mean androgen levels are within the normal range, a significant minority have an exaggerated response to corticotropin stimulation. The magnitude of this response is inversely related to insulin sensitivity. Thus, premature adrenarche may be the first sign of insulin resistance or PCOS in some individuals. Treatment of coexisting obesity and long-term follow-up are indicated to address potential complications of PCOS and insulin resistance. Isolated premature menarche is vaginal bleeding at age 1 to 9 years in the absence of other signs of puberty. The bleeding is usually limited to a few days. It can recur for 1 to 6 years and then cease. The etiology is uncertain. Most cases are associated with subsequent normal pubertal development and fertility. The differential diagnosis includes vaginal foreign bodies, trauma, sexual abuse, vaginal infection, or neoplasms such as rhabdomyosarcoma, McCune-Albright syndrome (in which menarche may occur before other manifestations of sexual precocity), and primary hypothyroidism. In central precocious puberty, GnRH prematurely stimulates increased gonadotropin secretion. Central precocious puberty may occur in children in whom there is no structural abnormality, in which case it is termed constitutional or idiopathic. Constitutional (idiopathic) sexual precocity is the most common cause of precocious puberty. It is often familial and represents the so-called tail of the Gaussian curve (i.e., the early 2.5% for the age distribution for the onset of puberty). In many of these girls, puberty is slowly progressive, but in a few, development progresses rapidly. The major complication of sexual precocity is limitation of height. Thus, therapy may be warranted to prevent this consequence. Figure 29.17 Five-year-old girl with development of pubic hair (A) as shown more closely in (B) (precocious adrenarche). Gonadotropin levels were prepubertal, and bone age was appropriate for age. No further development occurred until breast budding at approximately age 9. Figure 29.18 Left: A71/2-year-old girl with Tanner stage 4 pubertal development who began menstruating 1 month earlier. She was 57 inches tall (above the 95th percentile). Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were consistent with her development. A large neoplasm that proved to be a hypothalamic hamartoma was present on computed tomography scan. Pubertal development began at about 5 years of age. Figure 29.19 Right: A: A101/2-year-old girl with 21-hydroxylase deficiency before treatment. 17-Ketosteroid (KS) excretion was 34 mg per day.

The diagnosis and treatment of endocrine disorders in childhood and adolescence. 3rd ed. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas, 1965:439, with permission.)\n\n\n\nAlternatively, central precocious puberty may result from a tumor, infection, congenital abnormality, or traumatic injury affecting the hypothalamus. A number of congenital malformations, including hydrocephalus, craniostenosis, arachnoid cysts, and septo-optic dysplasia, can be associated with precocious puberty (and with sexual infantilism). A common etiology (2% to 28%) of central precocious puberty is a hypothalamic hamartoma. It is a congenital malformation composed of a heterotopic mass of nerve tissue containing GnRH neurosecretory neurons, fiber bundles, and glial cells. It is not a true neoplasm and it generally does not change over time based on long-term follow-up studies with periodic CT or MRI scans. Hamartomas appear as isodense, abnormal fullnesses that do not enhance with contrast material. Extreme precocity (usually before 3 years of age) and the absence of tumor markers, such as β-human chorionic gonadotropin and α-fetoprotein, suggest a hamartoma (72). Hamartomas can be associated with laughing (gelastic) seizures, behavioral disturbances, mental retardation, and dysmorphic syndromes. It appears that hamartomas produce GnRH in a pulsatile manner and thus stimulate gonadotropin secretion (Fig. 29.18) (73). Precocious pubertal development can be controlled with GnRH-agonist therapy (74). Because deaths were reported\n\n\n\nPrecocious Puberty of Peripheral Origin after neurosurgical extirpation, the latter should be reserved for management of hamartomas associated with intractable seizures or hydrocephalus (75). The efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) in increasing adult height is undisputed only in early-onset (girls less than 6 years old) central precocious puberty (76). Concerns of weight gain and long-term decrease in bone mineral density with the use of GnRHa do not seem to be warranted. The most important clinical criterion for initiating GnRHa treatment is documented progression of pubertal development over a 3-to 6-month period. This observational period may not be necessary if the child is at or past Tanner stage 3, particularly with advanced skeletal maturation. It appears that discontinuation of GnRHa at a chronological age of about 11 years and a bone age of about 12 years is associated with maximum adult height (77–79). There are a variety of GnRHa formulations, and the choice of a particular agent depends on patient and physician preference. In gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty, production of estrogens or androgens from the ovaries, adrenals, or rare steroid-secreting neoplasms leads to early pubertal development. Small functional ovarian cysts, typically asymptomatic, are common in children and may cause transient sexual precocity (80). Simple cysts (with a benign ultrasonographic appearance) can be observed and usually resolve over time. Of the various ovarian neoplasms that can secrete estrogens, granulosa-theca cell tumors occur most frequently but are still rare (81). Although such tumors may grow rapidly, more than two-thirds are benign. Exposure to exogenous estrogens can mimic gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty. Ingestion of oral contraceptives, other estrogen-containing pharmaceutical agents, and estrogen-contaminated foods, and the topical use of estrogens, are implicated in cases of precocious development in infants and children. Ingestion of exogenous steroids over a considerable length of time is required to induce changes typical of complete precocious development. The McCune-Albright syndrome is characterized by the classic triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone, irregular caf´e-au-lait spots on the skin, and GnRH-independent sexual precocity. The caf´e-au-lait spots are usually large, do not cross the midline, and have irregular “coast of Maine” margins. They are often located on the same side as the bony lesions. Sexual precocity often begins in the first 2 years and usually presents with menstrual bleeding. Girls develop sexual precocity as a result of functioning ovarian cysts. Serum estradiol is elevated. Other endocrinopathies may include hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, and hyperparathyroidism. Osteomalacia, hepatic abnormalities, and cardiac arrhythmia may occur. Mutations of the Gsα subunit of the G protein, which couples extracellular hormonal signals to the activation of adenylate cyclase, are responsible for the autonomous hyperfunction of the endocrine glands and, presumably, for the other defects present in this disorder (82). Treatment with a GnRH agonist is not effective because the precocious pubertal development is GnRH independent. Treatment with aromatase inhibitors, such as testolactone and fadrozole, has mixed results. A multicenter trial showed that tamoxifen decreases vaginal bleeding, growth rate, and the rate of bone age advancement (83). 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency Most patients with classic CAH have 21-hydroxylase deficiency (Fig. 29.19). All forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency are caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the human CYP21A2 gene, which encodes the 21-hydroxylase enzyme; in the carrier, heterozygote state, only one allele is mutated (85). Two CYP21A2 genes, a3 CYP21A2B gene encoding the functional enzyme and a pseudogene termed CYP21A2A, are situated very close to each other within the major histocompatibility locus on the short arm of chromosome 6. At least one-fourth of cases of 21-hydroxylase deficiency result from unequal crossover and genetic recombination between the two genes during meiosis. Severe mutations do not correlate with severe phenotype, and phenotypic variability likely depends on the activity of other interacting genes. Neonatal screening suggests an incidence of about 1 in 15,000 births. Because of the location of the gene within the major histocompatibility locus, siblings with 21-hydroxylase deficiency usually have identical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. There are various forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, including simple virilizing (typically identified at birth because of genital ambiguity), salt-wasting (in which there is impairment of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid secretion), and late-onset or nonclassic (in which heterosexual development occurs at the expected age of puberty). The so-called classic form includes the simple virilizing and salt-wasting forms. The nonclassic form is discussed in the following section on heterosexual pubertal development. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase results in the impairment of the conversion of 17αhydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol and of progesterone to deoxycorticosterone (Fig. 29.20). As a consequence, precursors accumulate, and there is increased conversion to adrenal androgens. Because the development of the external genitalia is controlled by androgens, in the classic form of this disorder, girls are born with ambiguous genitalia, including an enlarged clitoris and fusion of the labioscrotal folds and the urogenital sinus. The internal female organs (including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries) develop normally because they are not affected by the increased androgen levels. In three-quarters of cases with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, salt-wasting occurs, as defined by hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. It is important to recognize that the extent of virilization may be the same in simple virilizing and salt-wasting CAH. Thus, even a mildly virilized newborn with 21-hydroxylase deficiency should be observed for signs of a potentially life-threatening crisis within the first weeks of life. During childhood, untreated girls with the classic form grow rapidly but have advanced bone ages, enter puberty early, experience early closure of their epiphyses, and ultimately are short in stature as adults. CAH, with appropriate therapy, is the only inherited disorder of sexual differentiation in which normal pregnancy and childbearing are possible. The classic forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency are easily diagnosed based on the presence of genital ambiguity and markedly elevated levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. Some states in the US initiated neonatal screening programs to detect 21-hydroxylase deficiency at birth. 3β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Deficiency of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD), caused by mutations in the HSD3B2 gene that encodes the 3β-HSDII enzyme, affects the synthesis of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and sex steroids. Typically, levels of 17hydroxypregnenolone and DHEA are elevated (Fig. 29.20). The classic form of the disorder, detectable at birth, is quite rare, and affected girls may be masculinized only slightly. In severe cases, salt wasting may be present. A nonclassic form of this disorder may be associated with heterosexual precocious pubertal development (as is the classic form if untreated), but postpubertal hyperandrogenism occurs more often. The androgen excess in individuals with nonclassic 3β-HSD deficiency appears to result from androgens derived from the peripheral conversion of increased serum concentrations of DHEA. This disorder is inherited in autosomal recessive fashion, with allelism at the 3β-HSD gene on chromosome 1 believed to be responsible for the varying degrees of enzyme deficiency. 11-Hydroxylase Deficiency The classic form of 11-hydroxylase deficiency is believed to constitute 5% to 8% of all cases of CAH. Deficiency in 11-hydroxylase, caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene, results in the inability to convert 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and the consequent accumulation of androgen precursors (Fig. 29.20). Markedly elevated levels of 11deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone are present in the disorder. Because deoxycorticosterone acts as a mineralocorticoid, many individuals with this disorder become hypertensive. A mild\n\n\n\nFigure 29.20 Gonadal and adrenal steroid pathways and the enzymes required for steroid conversion.

The normal menstrual cycle and the control of ovulation. In: Becker KL, ed. Principles and practice of endocrinology and metabolism. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, A: JB Lippincott, 1995:868–880, with permission.) nonclassic form of 11-hydroxylase deficiency was reported but apparently is very uncommon (84). Treatment of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia The treatment of CAH involves providing replacement doses of the deficient steroid hormones. Hydrocortisone (10 to 20 mg/m2 body surface area) or its equivalent is given daily in divided doses to suppress the elevated levels of pituitary corticotropin present and thus suppress the elevated androgen levels. With such treatment, signs of androgen excess should regress. In children, growth velocity, bone age, and hormone levels should be monitored carefully because both overreplacement and underreplacement can result in premature closure of the epiphyses and short stature. Data now indicate that early diagnosis and compliance with therapy lead to adult height within 1 standard deviation of the anticipated target height in girls with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (86). Mineralocorticoid replacement is generally required in individuals with 21-hydroxylase deficiency whether or not they are salt losing. The intent of glucocorticoid therapy should be to suppress morning 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels to between 300 and 900 ng/dL. Sufficient ﬂudrocortisone should be given daily to suppress plasma renin activity to less than 5 mg/mL per hour. It is possible to diagnose 21-hydroxylase deficiency prenatally in patients known to be at risk (84). The diagnosis is established by documenting elevated levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone or 21-deoxycortisol in amniotic ﬂuid. Genetic diagnosis using specific probes and cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis is possible. Dexamethasone (20 μg/kg/day in three divided doses) can be administered to the pregnant women beginning before the ninth week of gestation because the urogenital sinus begins to form at nine weeks of gestation. If the fetus is determined to be a male or an unaffected female upon DNA analysis, treatment is discontinued. Otherwise, treatment is continued to term. Human studies found that this treatment regimen is effective in reducing virilization in the genetic female so that genitoplasty was not needed in the majority of cases (87,88). The majority of studies proved that this management scheme is effective for both mother and the child. Maternal complications, including hypertension, massive weight gain, and overt Cushing syndrome, were noted in about 1% of pregnancies in which the mothers are given low doses of dexamethasone. All maternal complications disappear after delivery. The long-term effects of this treatment strategy on the physical and neurodevelopmental health of the offspring remains unclear. A recent systematic review concluded that dexamethasone seems to reduce virilization without significant adverse maternal or fetal effects, though the available data allow merely weak inferences to be made (89). Despite the risks and the nonuniformity of beneficial outcome to affected female fetuses, many parents may choose prenatal medical treatment because of the psychological impact of ambiguous genitalia. Girls with ambiguous genitalia may require reconstructive surgery, including clitoral recession and vaginoplasty. Timing of such surgery is debated, but the girl must be of appropriate size to ensure the surgery is as simple as possible. The most common cause of heterosexual development at the expected age of puberty is PCOS (Fig. 29.21). Because the syndrome is heterogeneous and poorly defined, clinical difficulties result in diagnosis and management (90). For the sake of simplicity, PCOS may be defined as LH-dependent hyperandrogenism (91). The Rotterdam criteria are commonly used to identify individuals with PCOS and require the presence of at least two of the following: oligoor anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, with exclusion of other etiologies (CAH, androgen-secreting tumors, Cushing syndrome) (92). Polycystic ovaries ultrasonically are defined as the presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2 to 9 mm in diameter and/or increased ovarian volume (>10 mL). Most clinical manifestations arise as a consequence of the hyperandrogenism and often include hirsutism beginning at or near puberty and irregular menses from the age of menarche because of oligoovulation or anovulation. Clinical manifestations are as follows: 1. Affected girls may be but are not necessarily somewhat overweight. 2. In rare instances, menarche may be delayed, and primary amenorrhea may occur. 3. Basal levels of LH tend to be elevated in most affected individuals, and androgen production is invariably increased, even though circulating levels of androgens may be near the upper limits of the normal range in many affected women. Figure 29.21 Typical facial hirsutism in three women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. A: 25-year-old. 4. In anovulatory women, estrone levels are typically greater than estradiol levels. 5. Because circulating levels of estrogens are not diminished in PCOS and androgen levels are only mildly elevated, affected girls become both feminized and masculinized at puberty. This is an important feature because girls with classic forms of CAH who do not experience precocious puberty (and even those who do) only become masculinized at puberty (i.e., they do not develop breasts). 6. Some degree of insulin resistance may be present, even in the absence of overt glucose intolerance (93). 7. Polycystic ovaries are frequently, but not always present in ultrasound exami nation. Distinguishing PCOS from the nonclassic forms of CAH is problematic and controversial (94,95). The evaluation is as follows: 1. Some clinicians advocate measurement of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in all women who develop hirsutism. Although values of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone are commonly elevated more than 100-fold in individuals with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, they may or may not be elevated in nonclassic late-onset forms of the disorder. 2. Measurement of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone can identify women with various forms of 11-hydroxylase deficiency. 3. Basal levels of DHEAS and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone may be moderately elevated in patients with PCOS, making the diagnosis even more difficult. 4. To screen for CAH, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone should be measured in early morning. 5. In women with regular cyclic menses, it is important to measure 17αhydroxyprogesterone only in the follicular phase because basal levels increase at midcycle and in the luteal phase. Figure 29.21 (Continued ) B: 21-year-old C: 17-year-old. Measurements of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone appear to be of value in populations at high risk for nonclassic late-onset 21-hydroxylase deficiency. In the white population, the gene occurs in only about 1 in 1,000 individuals, but it occurs in 1 in 27 Ashkenazi Jews, 1 in 40 Hispanics, 1 in 50 Yugoslavs, and 1 in 300 Italians (84). The incidence is increased among Eskimos and French Canadians. Alternatively, screening might be restricted to hirsute teenagers presenting with the more “typical” features of nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, including severe hirsutism beginning at puberty, “ﬂattening” of the breasts (i.e., defeminization), shorter\n\n\n\nFigure 29.22 Left: A 19-year-old girl with secondary amenorrhea and severe acne and hirsutism beginning at the normal age of puberty. Stimulatory testing with corticotropin documented nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Flattening of the breasts is apparent. She was shorter than her one sister and her mother. Figure 29.23 Right: Newborn girl with 46,XX karyotype and genital ambiguity. There is obvious clitoral hypertrophy, paired frenula, so-called scrotalization of the labia, and a common urogenital sinus (shown by the probe). She had 21-hydroxylase deficiency. (From Rebar RW. Normal and abnormal sexual differentiation and pubertal development. In: Moore TR, Reiter RC, Rebar RW, et al., eds. Gynecology and obstetrics: a longitudinal approach. New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1993:97–133, with permission.) stature than other family members, and increased DHEAS levels (between 5,000 and 7,000 ng/mL). Women with a strong family history of hirsutism or hypertension might be screened (49) (Fig. 29.22). Basal Levels of 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone Basal levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone higher than 800 ng/dL are virtually diagnostic of CAH. Levels between 300 and 800 ng/dL require stimulatory testing with corticotropin to distinguish between PCOS and CAH. To complicate the situation even further, nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency may occur even when basal levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone are below 300 ng/dL, thus requiring stimulatory testing in those cases. Cosyntropin Stimulation Test The most commonly used stimulatory test involves measurement of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone 30 minutes after administration of a bolus of 0.25 mg of synthetic cosyntropin (Cortrosyn) (96). In normal women, this value seldom exceeds 400 ng/dL. Patients with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency achieve peak levels of 3,000 ng/dL or higher. Patients with nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency commonly achieve levels of 1,500 ng/dL or more. Heterozygous carriers achieve peak levels up to about 1,000 ng/dL. In hirsute women with hypertension, 11-deoxycortisol levels can be determined during the test. If both 11-deoxycortisol and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels are increased, the rare 11-hydroxylase deficiency is present. Only measurements of several steroid precursors after corticotropin stimulation can identify individuals with nonclassic forms of 3β-HSD deficiency. The elevated levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone present in all forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency are rapidly suppressed by administration of exogenous corticoids. Even a single dose of a glucocorticoid such as dexamethasone will suppress 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in CAH but not in virilizing ovarian and adrenal neoplasms. Hirsutism It is suggested that androgen-receptor blockade may be preferable to glucocorticoids as primary treatment of nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency (97). Although menses usually (but not always) become regular shortly after beginning therapy with glucocorticoids, the hirsutism in this disorder is remarkably refractory to glucocorticoids. Distinguishing nonclassic forms of CAH from idiopathic hirsutism may be problematic. Individuals with idiopathic hirsutism have regular ovulatory menses, thus effectively eliminating PCOS from consideration. Confusion can be created by the fact that some women with nonclassic CAH may continue to ovulate. Basal levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone are normal in idiopathic hirsutism, as is the response to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation. Idiopathic hirsutism represents enhanced androgen action at the hair follicle (98). Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis The term mixed gonadal dysgenesis is used to designate those individuals with asymmetric gonadal development, with a germ cell tumor or a testis on one side and an undifferentiated streak, rudimentary gonad, or no gonad on the other side. Most individuals with this rare disorder have a mosaic karyotype of 45,X/46,XY and are raised as girls who experience virilization at puberty. Gonadectomy is indicated to remove the source of androgens and eliminate any risk for neoplasia. Rare Forms of Male Pseudohermaphroditism\n\n\n\nIndividuals who have rare forms of male pseudohermaphroditism, especially 5α-reductase deficiency (the so-called penis at 12 syndrome) and the Reifenstein syndrome, generally have ambiguous female genitalia with variable virilization at puberty. Cushing syndrome may occur rarely during the pubertal years, as may adrenal or ovarian androgen-secreting neoplasms. Ambiguous external genitalia in a newborn constitutes a major diagnostic challenge. Prompt evaluation is of critical importance to identify a possible life-threatening disorder and to assign the appropriate gender. The prime diagnosis until ruled out is CAH because it is the only condition that is life-threatening. Extreme sensitivity is required in interacting with the family, and no attempt should be made to guess the sex of the baby. The incidence of genital ambiguity is 1 in 4,500, although some degree of male undervirilization, or female virilization may be present in as many as 2% of live births (99,100). Physical Signs During the 3 to 4 days required for evaluation, it is important to be supportive of the parents. Many clinicians believe that it is important not to attach any unusual significance to the genital ambiguity and to treat the abnormality as just another “birth defect.” Physicians should emphasize that the child should undergo normal psychosexual development regardless of the sex-of-rearing selected. Either a name compatible with either sex should be chosen or the naming of the infant should be delayed until the studies are completed. Although the diagnosis is not usually obvious on examination, there are some helpful distinguishing features (Fig. 29.23). In normal boys, there is only a single midline frenulum on the ventral side of the phallus; in normal girls, there are two frenula lateral to the mid-line. A girl with clitoral enlargement still has two frenula, and a boy with hypospadias has a single midline frenulum or several irregular fibrous bands (chordee). It is important to determine whether any m¨ullerian derivatives are present. Studies suggest that MRI may be the most effective way of evaluating the infant for the presence of m¨ullerian tissue (101). The location or consistency of the gonad may be helpful in deducing its composition. A gonad located in the labial or inguinal regions almost always contains testicular tissue. A testis is generally softer than an ovary or a streak gonad and is more apt to be surrounded by blood vessels imparting a reddish cast. An ovary is more often white, fibrous, and convoluted. A gonad that varies in consistency may be an ovotestis or a testis or a streak gonad that underwent neoplastic transformation. If a well-differentiated fallopian tube is absent on only one side, the side without the tube probably contains a testis or ovotestis. The fact that there is uncertainty about the sex of one’s baby is devastating and incomprehensible for most parents. Parents require reassurance that either a male or female gender will be assigned ultimately. Optimum clinical management should comprise of the following (67): 1. Gender assignment must be avoided before expert evaluation of newborns. 2. Evaluation and long-term management must be performed at a center with an experienced multidisciplinary team (pediatric endocrinologist, pediatric urologist, geneticist, clinical psychologist, and gynecologist). 3. All individuals should receive a gender assignment after appropriate assessment. 4. Open communication with patients and families is essential, and participation in decision making should be encouraged. 5. Patient and family concerns should be respected and addressed in strict confidence. First-line testing in newborns includes: 1. Karyotyping with X-and Y-specific probe detection (even when prenatal karyotype is available) 2. Measurement of serum 17-hydroprogesterone, testosterone, gonadotropins, antim¨ullerian hormone, and electrolytes 3. Abdominopelvic ultrasound (to assess anatomy of the vagina, uterus, or urogenital sinus, exclude renal anomalies, and locate any inguinal gonads) 4. Urinalysis (to check for protein as a screen for any associated renal anomaly)\n\n\n\nThe results of these investigations are generally available within 48 hours and sufficient to develop a working diagnosis. If needed, additional testing may include (102): 1. Human chorionic gonadotropin-and adrenocorticotropin-stimulation tests to assess testicular and adrenal steroid biosynthesis 2. 3. 4. Biopsies of gonadal material 5. Although genital ambiguity is usually identified at birth, it may not be recognized for several years. Questions about changing the sex-of-rearing may arise. It was believed that sexof-rearing may be changed before 2 years of age without psychologically damaging the child, but experience with individuals with 5α-reductase deficiency suggests that gender changes may be made after 2 years of age in certain instances (103). In any case, surgery for genital ambiguity to make the external genitalia (and development) as compatible with the sex-of-rearing of the child is warranted but was not always successful. Clitoral recession and clitorectomy are the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Masculinized external genitalia can be classified into five “Prader” stages. Excessive androgen exposure results in virilization to varying degrees, including clitoral enlargement, labial fold fusion, and rostral migration of the urethral/vaginal perineal orifice. Prader stage V defines virilization resulting in complete labioscrotal fusion, a penile phallus with the urethra opening on the glans. Clitoroplasty is required at an early stage after it is established that a Prader stage V “male” has CAH and needs to be reassigned to the female sex (104). Teratogens It is important to recognize that ambiguous genitalia can result from the maternal ingestion of various teratogens, most of which are synthetic steroids (Table 29.3). Exposure to the teratogen must occur early in pregnancy, during genital organogenesis. Not all exposed fetuses manifest the same anomalies or even the presence of any anomalies. In principle, most synthetic steroids with androgenic properties, including weakly androgenic progestins, can affect female genital differentiation. The doses required to produce genital ambiguity are generally so great that the concern is only theoretical. The one agent that can lead to genital ambiguity when ingested in\n\n\n\nTable 29.3 Androgens and Progestogens Potentially Capable of Producing Genital Ambiguitya aThose agents proved to cause genital ambiguity do so only when administered in relatively high doses. Insufficient data exist regarding effects of dimethisterone and norgestrel. In low doses (e.g., as in oral contraceptives), progestins, even including norethindrone, seem unlikely to virilize a female fetus. clinically used quantities is danazol. There is no evidence that inadvertent ingestion of oral contraceptives, which contain relatively low doses of either mestranol or ethinyl estradiol and a 19-nor-steroid, results in virilization (105,106). 1.']","['The karyotype should be determined in any individual with delayed puberty and increased basal FSH concentrations', 'Regardless of the karyotype, the individual with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism has some form of ovarian “failure” (i.e., primary hypogonadism)', 'The diagnosis of Turner syndrome requires the presence of characteristic features in phenotypic females coupled with complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome, with or without cell line mosaicism', 'Most affected individuals have a 45,X karyotype, while others have mosaic karyotypes (i.e., 45,X/46,XX; 45,X/46,XY)', 'Even in the presence of typical Turner stigmata, a karyotype is indicated to eliminate the possibility of the presence of any portion of a Y chromosome', 'Analysis of pooled data suggests that the presence of Y chromosome material is associated with a 12% risk of a gonadoblastoma', 'The term pure gonadal dysgenesis refers to 46,XX or 46,XY phenotypic females who have streak gonads', 'This condition may occur sporadically or may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait or as an X-linked trait in XY gonadal dysgenesis.']",0.012779552715654952,"[""Secondary sexual characteristics Present Primary Pregnancy hCG −hCG +Yes No Physical exam • If risk of endometrial  scarring, advise HSG  saline hysterogram or  hysteroscopy &  culture’s to exclude  Asherman's, cervical  stenosis and infection Normal Abnormal – consider karyotype TSH, PRL, FSH, clinical evaluation of estrogen status Abnormal TSH Normal TSH Normal PRL High PRL Hyperprolactinemia Absent Physical exam Normal Normal or low Absent uterus FSH level High Karyotype • 5α-reductase deficiency • 17–20 lyase deficiency • 17α-hydroxylase deficiency (all with XY karyotype) • Kallman's syndrome • Physiologic delay • Disorders of low estrogen status before puberty • XX • Y line • Turner (XO) • Hyperthyroidism • Hypothyroidism • Mlerian anomaly • Androgen insensitivity • True hermaphrodite"", 'TABLE 13-1.

","['5. Vaginal ultrasound for assessment of antral follicle count in the ovaries can be considered (may help establish the diagnosis of PCOS or suggest POI) 6. Imaging of the pituitary and hypothalamic assessment if prolactin is elevated or if hypothalamic amenorrhea is suspected (particularly if CNS symptoms are present or there is no clear explanation for hypothalamic amenorrhea). Assessment of Estrogen Status\n\n\n\nThe presence of vaginal dryness or hot ﬂashes increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of hypoestrogenism. A sample of vaginal secretions can be obtained during the physical examination, and mucosal estrogen response can be demonstrated by the presence of superficial cells. A serum estradiol level higher than 40 pg/mL is considered indicative of significant estrogen production, but interassay discrepancies often exist and serum estrogen levels can vary greatly on a day-today basis for a given woman. Vaginal ultrasound demonstrating a thin endometrium suggests that a patient is hypoestrogenic, unless there is reason to suspect that the patient lacks functional endometrium. A DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) scan to determine bone mineral density should be considered for a patient in whom long-term hypoestrogenism is suspected. There is little utility in routine performance of a progestogen challenge test to determine the patient’s estrogen status. False positives and false negatives are common. Consideration should be given to thyroid disorders and hyperprolactinemia in women with amenorrhea because of the relatively common incidence of these conditions. 1. Sensitive TSH assays can be used to evaluate hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Further evaluation of a thyroid disorder is required if abnormalities in TSH levels are found. Mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction are unlikely to cause amenorrhea. Given the general health implications of thyroid dysfunction and readily available treatments, routine assessment of TSH is reasonable for women with amenorrhea. 2. Prolactin is most accurately obtained in a patient who is fasting and who has not had any recent breast stimulation to avoid concluding that a patient is hyperprolactinemic on the basis of a transient prolactin elevation. If a patient still has some menstrual cycles, it is advisable to obtain the prolactin level in the follicular phase. Assessment of serum FSH levels is required to determine whether the patient has hypergonadotropic, hypogonadotropic, or eugonadotropic amenorrhea. A circulating FSH level of greater than 25 to 40 mIU/mL indicated on at least two blood samples is indicative of hypergonadotropic amenorrhea. Hypergonadotropism implies that the cause of amenorrhea is ovarian insufficiency. The history should establish whether the cause of ovarian insufficiency is chemotherapy or radiation therapy. One test that is likely to be performed increasingly frequently is serum AMH. AMH is a product of the granulosa cells. AMH levels are low in women with POI and high in women with PCOS. AMH may be used more commonly in the evaluation of amenorrhea, but its assessment is not yet part of routine evaluation. If the diagnosis of POI is confirmed, the patient should be tested for: 1. FMR1 premutation 2. Karyotype 3. 21-hydroxylase antibody. FMR1 premutation testing will reveal women at risk for bearing a child with fragile X syndrome, which may be important information for other family members. The goal of the peripheral blood karyotype is to identify an absent or abnormal X chromosome and to identify whether or not any portion of a Y chromosome is present. In situ hybridization studies may prove the existence of Y chromosomal material with a Y-specific probe when the karyotype is normal and should be assessed if there are clinical signs to suggest that a Y-bearing cell line is present despite normal routine peripheral blood karyotype (125). It is important to identify Y chromosomal material so it may be removed to prevent malignant degeneration. Although commonly suggested that\n\n\n\nAssessment of the Pituitary and Hypothalamus karyotype only be performed if the patient is under age 30, it should be noted that rare patients with Turner syndrome developed amenorrhea after age 35. In addition, some patients who present over the age of 30 may have actually had the onset of POI at a younger age but were unaware because of the use of oral contraceptives. Therefore, consideration should be given to performance of karyotype, regardless of the patient’s age. Testing for 21-hydroxylase antibody will identify women at risk for adrenal crisis. If a diagnosis of PCOS is suspected, the patient should have: 1. Documentation of hyperandrogenism (either by serum total testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin or free testosterone and/or by presence of physical findings such as acne, hirsutism, and androgenic alopecia), 2. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone to exclude congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting from 21-hydroxylase deficiency, particularly if the patient is at increased risk (highest prevalence is among Ashkenazi Jews, Hispanics, Yugoslavs, Native American Inuits in Alaska, and Italians) (79), 3. If the diagnosis of PCOS is made, the patient should undergo a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test and a fasting lipid profile. If the patient is hypoestrogenic and the FSH level is not high, pituitary and hypothalamic lesions should be excluded. 1. A complete neurologic examination may help localize a lesion. 2. Either CT or MRI scanning should be performed to confirm the presence or absence of a tumor. MRI will identify smaller lesions than CT; if a lesion is too small for identification by CT, it may be clinically insignificant. MRI offers the advantage of avoiding exposure to x-ray. 3. The patient’s history of weight changes, exercise, eating habits, and body image is an important factor in determining whether anorexia nervosa, malnutrition, obesity, exercise, or stress may be responsible for amenorrhea. Patients with certain specific clinical findings should undergo screening for other hormonal alterations: 1. Androgen levels should be assessed in any hirsute patient to ensure that adrenal and ovarian tumors are not present and to aid in the diagnosis of PCOS. 2. Acromegaly is suggested by coarse facial features, large doughy hands, and hyperhidrosis and may be confirmed by measuring IGF-1 levels. 3. In patients with truncal obesity, hirsutism, hypertension, and erythematous striae, Cushing syndrome should be ruled out by assessing 24-hour urinary cortisol levels or performing a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test or late night salivary cortisol (126). It is important to confirm that the patient is not taking exogenous glucocorticoid. Treatment for Women with Amenorrhea in the Presence of Normal Pelvic Anatomy and Normal Secondary Sexual Characteristics\n\n\n\nThe treatment of nonanatomic causes of amenorrhea associated with normal secondary sexual characteristics varies widely according to the cause. The underlying disorder should be treated whenever possible. Patients who are pregnant may be counseled regarding the options for continued care. When thyroid abnormalities are detected, thyroid hormone, radioactive iodine, or antithyroid drugs may be administered as appropriate. When hyperprolactinemia is present, treatment may include discontinuation of contributing medications, treatment with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, and, rarely, surgery for particularly large pituitary tumors. When POI causes amenorrhea, hormone replacement may be considered to diminish symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis. Counseling regarding the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy is indicated. Gonadectomy is required when a Y cell line is present. Surgical removal, radiation therapy, or a combination of both is advocated for treatment of CNS tumors other than prolactinomas. It may be necessary to treat individuals who have panhypopituitarism with various replacement regimens after all the deficits are elucidated. These regimens include estrogen and progestogen replacement for lack of gonadotropins, corticosteroid replacement for lack of ACTH, thyroid hormone for lack of TSH, and desmopressin acetate (1-deamino-8-D-AVP [DDAVP]) to replace vasopressin. The treatment of amenorrhea associated with hypothalamic dysfunction depends on the underlying cause: 1. Hormonally active ovarian tumors are surgically removed (rare). 2. Obesity, malnutrition or chronic disease, Cushing syndrome, and acromegaly should be specifically treated. 3. Stress-induced amenorrhea may respond to psychotherapy. 4. Exercise-induced amenorrhea may improve with moderation of activity and weight gain, when appropriate. If hypoestrogenism persists, higher doses of estrogen may be needed in these women than in older menopausal women to maintain bone density. In addition, 1,200 to 1,500 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D daily are advised. Bisphosphonates do not improve bone density in amenorrheic athletes because it is lack of bone formation rather than increased resorption that causes the osteopenia. In addition, the use of bisphosphonates is not advised because they can be deposited into the bone, and long-term effects, especially during pregnancy, are unknown. 5. Treatment of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa generally demands a multidisciplinary approach, with severe cases requiring hospitalization (127). Chronic anovulation associated with PCOS may be treated after identifying the desires of the patient. Patients may be concerned about their lack of menstruation, not hirsutism, or infertility. The endometrium of these individuals should be protected from the environment of unopposed estrogen that accompanies the anovulatory state. Oral contraceptives are a good alternative for those patients who require contraception. For those patients who are not candidates for oral contraceptive use, cyclic administration of progestogen is advised. Progestogen withdrawal will occur if there is an adequate estrogenic environment to induce proliferation of the endometrium, and it is not sufficient to cause withdrawal bleeding in patients who are hypoestrogenic (e.g., those who have amenorrhea associated with anorexia nervosa). Women with PCOS may require treatment for insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Regular periodic screening with an oral glucose load test and lipid panel is recommended for women with PCOS. Reduction in weight in obese women with PCOS leads to improved pregnancy rates, decreases hirsutism, and improves glucose and lipid levels (79). Insulin-sensitizing medications such as metformin and cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins can be considered. Ovulation induction is performed if pregnancy is desired, as described below. A common progestogen used to induce withdrawal bleeding and thus protect the endometrium from hyperplastic transformation is medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 mg for 12 to 14 days per month). Occasionally, ovulation may occur; therefore, patients should be made aware that pregnancy is possible, and appropriate contraceptive measures should be used. Because there is theoretical concern that medroxyprogesterone acetate used in early pregnancy may increase the incidence of pseudohermaphroditism, a pregnancy test should be obtained if a woman fails to have a withdrawal bleed (128). Alternatively, progesterone suppositories (50 to 100 mg) or oral micronized progesterone (200 mg) can be given for 12 to 14 days per month to protect the endometrium from hyperplasia and induce withdrawal bleeding. No increased incidence of birth defects is associated with the use of natural progesterone (129). In hypoestrogenic individuals such as those with POI, estrogen replacement must be added to the progestogen for successful menstrual regulation and prevention of osteoporosis. The doses of estrogen needed for relief of symptoms in young women with POI are often higher than those that are used for older menopausal women (130). Women with POI (who would normally still be making hormone if the ovaries were functioning normally) are different from those reaching menopause at a median age of 51. Therefore, data regarding hormone therapy that were collected from women reaching menopause at the median age should not be extrapolated to younger women. Although there are no comparative data and no long-term prospectively collected data regarding hormone therapy for women with POI, the risks of hormone therapy are likely to be lower and the benefits potentially greater for younger women than for older women reaching menopause after the age of 50 (131). When chronic anovulation is caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia, glucocorticoid administration (i.e., dexamethasone 0.5 mg at bedtime) is sometimes successful in restoring the normal feedback mechanisms, thereby permitting regular menstruation and ovulation. Hirsutism Patients who have oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea resulting from chronic anovulation may have hirsutism. The most common cause of hirsutism and oligo-ovulation is PCOS. After ruling out androgen-secreting tumors and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, treatment may be aimed at decreasing coarse hair growth. Oral Contraceptives Oral contraceptives may be effective for hirsutism by decreasing ovarian androgen production and increasing circulating levels of sex hormone–binding globulin, leading to decreased free androgen in the circulation. Antiandrogens Spironolactone decreases androgen production and competes with androgens at the androgen receptor. Side effects include diuresis and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The use of spironolactone is typically combined with oral contraceptives to avoid irregular bleeding and to prevent pregnancy from occurring while on spironolactone. Flutamide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjuvant therapy in prostatic cancer and for treatment of hirsutism. Its effects are similar to those of spironolactone (132). Liver function should be monitored because of the rare complication of hepatotoxicity. Cyproterone acetate, a strong progestin and antiandrogen, is used abroad but is not available in the United States. It is usually administered in combination with ethinyl estradiol in an oral contraceptive. By decreasing circulating androgen and LH levels, and by inducing antagonism of androgen effects at the peripheral level, cyproterone acetate is effective in treating hirsutism (133). Finasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (Proscar) and male pattern baldness (Propecia). It is effective in treating hirsutism, although perhaps is no more effective than other available agents (134,135). Its major advantage is that it is exceptionally well tolerated and may be used when side effects preclude the use of other therapeutic options for hirsutism. All antiandrogens are teratogenic as they may lead to feminization of the external genitalia of a male fetus (ambiguous genitalia) if the patient should conceive while taking the medication. Therefore, antiandrogens are typically used in combination with oral contraceptives. GnRH Agonist Administration of GnRH agonist agents virtually eliminates ovarian steroid production, and estrogen-progestogen add-back therapy allows long-term administration and protection against osteoporosis. Eﬂornithine Hydrochloride Eﬂornithine hydrochloride is a topical cream that is approved by the FDA for use on the face and chin. Improvements in facial hirsutism may be seen in 4 to 8 weeks of twice-daily applications. Ovulation Induction A large subset of patients with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea and chronic anovulation seek care because they are unable to conceive (see Chapter 32). Ovulation induction therapy is generally the treatment of choice for such patients, but pretreatment counseling should be provided in sufficient detail to ensure realistic expectations. The patient should be provided with information regarding the chances of a successful pregnancy (considering age of the patient and treatment modality), potential complications (hyperstimulation and multiple gestation), expense, time, and psychological impact involved in completing the course of therapy. Treatment should be individualized (136). Earlier studies raised the possibility of a relationship between ovulation induction and the risk of ovarian cancer (137,138). Ongoing studies are attempting to address this issue conclusively, but data support an increase of approximately 2.5-fold in ovarian cancer in patients with infertility, which appears unrelated to the use of ovulation-inducing drugs (139140). There is no conclusive evidence to link fertility drug use and ovarian cancer; thus, no change in current ovulation induction practices seems warranted at present (141). Pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives before or after childbearing may protect against ovarian cancer. Clomiphene citrate is the usual first choice for ovulation induction in most patients because of its relative safety, efficacy, route of administration (oral), and relatively low cost (142). Clomiphene citrate is indicated primarily in patients with adequate levels of estrogen and normal levels of FSH and prolactin. It is generally ineffective in hypogonadotropic patients who already have a poor estrogen supply (143). Patients with inappropriate gonadotropin release (an increased LH-to-FSH ratio), such as that which occurs in PCOS, are candidates for therapy with clomiphene citrate. As many as 80% of certain patients can be expected to ovulate after clomiphene citrate therapy. Contraindications to the use of clomiphene citrate include pregnancy, liver disease, and preexisting ovarian cysts. Side effects include hot ﬂashes and poorly understood visual symptoms, which generally were viewed as an indication to discontinue subsequent clomiphene citrate use. The risk of multiple pregnancy is increased with clomiphene citrate compared with an overall of risk of approximately 8% (142). The majority of multiple gestations are twins; triplets and higher order multiple gestations are rare. The most commonly recommended treatment regimen for clomiphene citrate is 50 mg daily for 5 days, beginning on the third to fifth day of menstrual or withdrawal bleeding. Cycles may be monitored by measuring midluteal progesterone levels to assess ovulation. Ovulation may be confirmed by an appropriate rise of basal body temperature and menses occurring at the expected time after the temperature rise. Ultrasonographic monitoring to assess folliculogenesis may be helpful, especially when hCG is used to induce ovulation. Endometrial thinning caused by the antiestrogenic effects of clomiphene citrate may be detected with midcycle ultrasound. With these data, it is possible to immediately adjust the dose in the subsequent cycle if a given regimen is ineffective. Dosage increases of 50 mg per day are usually used, and more than 70% of conceptions occur at doses no higher than 100 mg per day for 5 days (144). Dosages higher than 150 mg per day for 5 days are usually ineffective, and patients who remain anovulatory with this dosage should undergo further evaluation accompanied by changes in the therapeutic plan. Longer courses of clomiphene citrate therapy, and adjunctive therapy with glucocorticoids, are suggested if a patient does not ovulate with standard therapy (145). Although a large randomized trial demonstrated that clomiphene alone is superior to metformin alone in achieving live birth in women with PCOS, a meta-analysis suggests that for some patients with PCOS, metformin and clomiphene combined may increase the likelihood of ovulation compared with clomiphene alone (146,147). Thinning of the endometrium at midcycle in the face of adequate midcycle estradiol and lack of success with repeated cycles of clomiphene are generally indications to consider injectable gonadotropins. Aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, were suggested as an option for ovulation induction (148). Women with PCOS who do not ovulate or become pregnant with clomiphene citrate, and women with hypogonadotropic hypoestrogenic anovulation, may be candidates for therapy with injectable gonadotropins. Available preparations include recombinant FSH and LH and products purified from the urine of menopausal women (FSH or FSH-LH combinations). Administration protocols and dosages vary widely and should be adjusted to individual needs. Safe administration requires careful monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasonography and, in some cases, serial estradiol measurements. In general, gonadotropins are administered at a dose of 50 to 150 IU per day by subcutaneous injection for 3 to 5 days, after which time estradiol and follicular monitoring commence. In most cycles, gonadotropin is administered for 7 to 12 days. Ovulation is triggered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of 5,000 to 10,000 IU hCG or subcutaneous injection of 250 μgof recombinant hCG once the lead follicle reaches 16 to 20 mm in diameter based on ultrasonographic assessments. Ovulation generally occurs approximately 38 to 40 hours after hCG administration. Luteal phase support is sometimes provided with the administration of progesterone supplementation or with additional injections of hCG. The two major complications associated with induction of ovulation with gonadotropins are multiple pregnancy (10% to 30%) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The incidence of both of these complications can be reduced but not eliminated by careful monitoring. Cycles complicated by the recruitment of numerous follicles or by high estradiol levels may be canceled by withholding the ovulatory dose of hCG. Selected patients may be converted safely to in vitro fertilization. Because severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is life-threatening and may lead to prolonged hospitalization, ovulation induction with gonadotropins generally is performed by experienced practitioners who devote a significant portion of their practice to the treatment of infertility. Ovulation induction with pulsatile GnRH may be effective in patients who have chronic anovulation associated with low levels of estrogen and gonadotropins. For therapy to be successful, a functional ovary and pituitary gland must be present. Patients with ovarian or pituitary failure do not respond to GnRH therapy. To be effective, GnRH must be administered in a pulsatile fashion, either intravenously or subcutaneously by a programmable pump. Ovulation induction with GnRH, as compared with gonadotropins, is associated with a relatively low incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple births. In addition, the need for appropriate timing of the ovulatory dose of hCG is avoided because patients treated with pulsatile GnRH have an appropriately timed endogenous LH surge. Disadvantages are mainly related to maintaining the programmable pump and injection site and lack of availability of an appropriate pump in the United States. After ovulation, luteal phase support is necessary and may be provided with hCG, progesterone, or continuation of the GnRH therapy. For women with overt POI (also known as premature ovarian failure, as noted above), there is no good evidence to suggest that any treatment can increase the chance of conception with autologous oocytes (85). Treatments that were tried include ovulation induction with clomiphene or gonadotropin, pretreatment with high-dose estrogen or gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonist followed by expectant management or gonadotropin stimulation, standard-dose hormone therapy followed by gonadotropin, and corticosteroid pretreatment followed by gonadotropin. Administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is suggested for women with POI (149). It is uncertain whether the benefit seen in preliminary reports will stand the test of time. If POI is diagnosed while a patient still has a significant supply of oocytes, fertility preservation could be considered if the patient is not able to consider conception at the time of diagnosis. In most cases, patients with prolonged amenorrhea are not diagnosed at a time when significant numbers of reproductively competent oocytes are present. Fertility preservation is an option for patients about to undergo gonadotoxic chemotherapy or if a patient is known (e.g., based on family history) to be at risk for POI. Either embryos or oocytes can be cryopreserved. There is more worldwide experience with cryopreservation of embryos. Improvements are occurring in techniques of oocyte and ovarian tissue cryopreservation (150,151). Patients with POI who desire pregnancy will in most cases have a high chance of having a child with the help of oocyte donation. Oocytes from donors may be harvested after ovulation induction, fertilized with sperm from the intended father, and transferred into the recipient’s uterus after the endometrium is appropriately prepared with estrogen and progesterone. Special concern is warranted for women with Turner syndrome who appear to have a maternal mortality of at least 2% (58). Rupture of the aorta may occur even if an echocardiogram shows no dilatation (152). It is suggested that all women with Turner syndrome undergo a full cardiac evaluation, including a cardiac MRI at a center with expertise in cardiovascular imaging, and that pregnancy be contraindicated if the patient has known congenital cardiovascular disease (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve or aortic coarctation) or with aortic size greater than 2 cm/m2 (153). 1.', '3.

These disorders, which include ovulatory dysfunction and abnormalities of the uterus or outflow tract, may present as amenorrhea or as irregular or short menstrual cycles.

"A 25-year-old female is brought to the physician by her mother who is concerned about her recent behaviors. The mother states that her daughter has been collecting “useless items” in her apartment over the last year. When she tried to persuade her daughter to throw away several years’ worth of old newspapers, her daughter had an angry outburst and refused to speak to her for two weeks. The patient reluctantly admits that she keeps “most things just in case they become useful later on.” She also states that she has felt less interested in seeing friends because she does not want them to come over to her apartment. She has also not been sleeping well, as her bed has become an additional storage space and she must sleep on her futon instead. The patient states that she is sometimes bothered by the messiness of her apartment, but otherwise doesn't think anything is wrong with her behavior. Physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A:Cognitive behavioral therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder
B:Admission to psychiatric facility
C:High dose SSRI for hoarding disorder
D:Tricyclic antidepressant for hoarding disorder
E:Intervention by patient’s mother to declutter the home
","['If the space can be used, it is only with great difficulty. Clutter is defined as a large group of usually unrelated or marginally related objects piled together in a disorganized fashion in spaces designed for other purposes (e.g., tabletops, ﬂoor, hallway). Criterion C emphasizes the ”active"" living areas of the home, rather than more peripheral areas, such as garages, attics, or basements, that are sometimes cluttered in homes of individuals with- out hoarding disorder. However, individuals with hoarding disorder often have posses— sions that spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other spaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace, and friends’ and relatives’ houses. In some cases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the intervention of third parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, local authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear the lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention. Hoarding disorder contrasts with normative collecting behavior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases the actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an indi- vidual with hoarding disorder. Normative collecting does not produce the clutter, dis- tress, or impairment typical of hoarding disorder. Symptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and / or clutter) must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, in- cluding maintaining a safe environment for self and others (Criterion D). In some cases, particularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the im— pairment may be apparent only to those around the individual. However, any attempts to discard or clear the possessions by third parties result in high levels of distress. Other common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism, avoidance, procrastination, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and distractibility. Some individuals with hoarding disorder live in unsanitary conditions that may be a log- ical consequence of severely cluttered spaces and/ or that are related to planning and or- ganizing difficulties. Animal hoarding can be defined as the accumulation of a large number of animals and a failure to provide minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, and veter- inary care and to act on the deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, star- vation, or death) and the environment (e.g., severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary conditions). Animal hoarding may be a special manifestation of hoarding disorder. Most individuals who hoard animals also hoard inanimate objects. The most prominent differ- ences between animal and object hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the poorer insight in animal hoarding. Nationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding disorder are not available. Com— munity surveys estimate the point prevalence of clinically significant hoarding in the\n\n\n\nUnited States and Europe to be approximately 2%—6%. Hoarding disorder affects both males and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greater prevalence among males. This contrasts with clinical samples, which are predominantly female. Hoarding symptoms appear to be almost three times more prevalent in older adults (ages 55—94 years) compared with younger adults (ages 34—44 years). Hoarding appears to begin early in life and spans well into the late stages. Hoarding symp- toms may first emerge around ages 11—15 years, start interfering with the individual’s ev- eryday functioning by the mid—ZOs, and cause clinically significant impairment by the mid-30s. Participants in clinical research studies are usually in their 505. Thus, the severity of hoarding increases with each decade of life. Once symptoms begin, the course of hoard- ing is often chronic, with few individuals reporting a waxing and waning course. Pathological hoarding in children appears to be easily distinguished from develop- mentally adaptive saving and collecting behaviors. Because children and adolescents typically do not control their living environment and discarding behaviors, the possible intervention of third parties (e.g., parents keeping the spaces usable and thus reducing in- terference) should be considered when making the diagnosis. Temperamental. Indecisiveness is a prominent feature of individuals with hoarding dis- order and their first-degree relatives. Environmental. Individuals with hoarding disorder often retrospectively report stressful and traumatic life events preceding the onset of the disorder or causing an exacerbation. Genetic and physiological. Hoarding behavior is familial, with about 50% of individu- als who hoard reporting having a relative who also hoards. Twin studies indicate that ap- proximately 50% of the variability in hoarding behavior is attributable to additive genetic factors. While most of the research has been done in Western, industrialized countries and urban communities, the available data from non-Westem and developing countries suggest that hoarding is a universal phenomenon with consistent clinical features. The key features of hoarding disorder (i.e., difficulties discarding, excessive amount of clutter) are generally comparable in males and females, but females tend to display more excessive acquisition, particularly excessive buying, than do males. Functional Consequences of Hoarding Disorder\n\n\n\nClutter impairs basic activities, such as moving through the house, cooking, cleaning, per- sonal hygiene, and even sleeping. Appliances may be broken, and utilities such as water and electricity may be disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. Quality of life is often considerably impaired. In severe cases, hoarding can put individuals at risk for fire, falling (especially elderly individuals), poor sanitation, and other health risks. Hoard- ing disorder is associated with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high social service utilization. Family relationships are frequently under great strain. Conﬂict with neighbors and local authorities is common, and a substantial proportion of individ- uals with severe hoarding disorder have been involved in legal eviction proceedings, and some have a history of eviction. Other medical conditions. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of another medical condition (Criterion E), such as trau- matic brain injury, surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or seizure control, cerebro- vascular disease, infections of the central nervous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis), or neurogenetic conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome. Damage to the anterior ven- tromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices has been particularly associated with the ex- cessive accumulation of objects. In these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present prior to the onset of the brain damage and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs. Some of these individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and are able to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them, whereas others appear to be very reluctant to discard anything. Neurodevelopmental disorders. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumula- tion of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Hoarding disorder is not di— agnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of delusions or negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Major depressive episode. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of energy during a major depressive episode. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears of contamination, harm, or feelings of incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Feelings of incompleteness (e.g., losing one’s identity, or having to document and preserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD symptoms associated with this form of hoarding. The accumulation of objects can also be the result of persistently avoid- ing onerous rituals (e.g., not discarding objects in order to avoid endless washing or check- ing rituals). \\\n\n\n\nIn OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual ex- periences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if exces- sive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to buy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid contaminating other people), not because of a genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of\n\n\n\nOCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair, used diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of such items is very unusual in hoarding disorder. When severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of 0CD but is judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and 0CD may be diagnosed. Neurocognitive disorders. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as neurocog- nitive disorder associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer’s disease. Typically, onset of the accumulating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neuro- cognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior may be accompanied by self—neglect and severe domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibi- tion, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self—injurious behaviors. Approximately 75% of individuals with hoarding disorder have a comorbid mood or anx- iety disorder. The most common comorbid conditions are major depressive disorder (up to 50% of cases), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and generalized anxiety disorder. Approximately 20% of individuals with hoarding disorder also have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for OCD. These comorbidities may often be the main reason for consul- tation, because individuals are unlikely to spontaneously report hoarding symptoms, and these symptoms are often not asked about in routine clinical interviews. Diagnostic Criteria 312.39 (F63.2)\n\n\n\nA. Recurrent pulling out of one’s hair, resulting in hair loss. B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling. C. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social. occupa- tional, or other important areas of functioning.', 'B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. D. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g.. excessive worries. as in generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with ap- pearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with posses- sions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder]; skin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as in stereotypic movement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation with substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive disorders; preoc- cupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies, as in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct dis- orders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought insertion or delu- sional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; or repetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum disorder). Specify it:\n\n\n\nWith good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that obsessive-compulsive dis- order beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insightldeiuslonai beiiets: The individual is completely convinced that obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true. Specify it:\n\n\n\nTic-related: The individual has a current or past history of a tie disorder. Many individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have dysfunctional beliefs. These beliefs can include an inﬂated sense of responsibility and the tendency to overesti- mate threat; perfectionism and intolerance of uncertainty; and over—importance of thoughts (e.g., believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as acting on it) and the need to control thoughts. Individuals with OCD vary in the degree of insight they have about the accuracy of the beliefs that underlie their obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Many individuals have good or fair insight (e.g., the individual believes that the house definitely will not, probably will not, or may or may not burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times). Some have poor insight (e.g., the individual believes that the house will probably burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times), and a few (4% or less) have absent insight/delusional beliefs (e.g., the in- dividual is convinced that the house will burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times). Insight can vary within an individual over the course of the illness. Poorer insight has been linked to worse long-term outcome. Up to 30% of individuals with OCD have a lifetime tic disorder. This is most common in males with onset of 0CD in childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those with- out a history of tic disorders in the themes of their 0CD symptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. The characteristic symptoms of 0CD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri- terion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images (e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions are not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and cause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neu- tralize them with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions (or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD have both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response to an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that some- thing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels ""just right”). The aim is to reduce the distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How- ever, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g., arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive (e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress. Criterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g., more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant a diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in— trusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (e.g., double-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com- pulsions vary across individuals with 0CD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms, spending 1—3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas others have nearly constant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating). The specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies between individuals. However, certain themes, or dimensions, are common, including those of cleaning (contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeating, ordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g., aggressive, sexual, or religious obsessions and related compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself or others and checking compulsions). Some individuals also have difficulties discarding and accumulate (hoard) objects as a consequence of typical obsessions and compulsions, such as fears of harming others. These themes occur across different cultures, are rela— tively consistent over time in adults with the disorder, and may be associated with differ- ent neural substrates. Importantly, individuals often have symptoms in more than one dimension. Individuals with 0CD experience a range of affective responses when confronted with situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, many individuals expe- rience marked anxiety that can include recurrent panic attacks. Others report strong feel- ings of disgust. While performing compulsions, some individuals report a distressing sense of ""incompleteness” or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound ”just right.”\n\n\n\nIt is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places, and things that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination con- cerns might avoid public situations (e.g., restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce ex- posure to feared contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm might avoid social interactions. The 12-month prevalence of 0CD in the United States is 1.2%, with a similar prevalence in— ternationally 0.1%—1.8%). Females are affected at a slightly higher rate than males in adulthood, although males are more commonly affected in childhood. In the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19.5 years, and 25% of cases start by age 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Symptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and / or clutter) must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, in- cluding maintaining a safe environment for self and others (Criterion D).

Labs: Abnormalities include ↑ serum alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium and phosphate levels; urinary pyridinolines may be helpful. Must be differentiated from metastatic bone disease. The majority of patients are asymptomatic and require no treatment. There is no cure for Paget’s disease. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin are used to slow osteoclastic bone resorption; NSAIDs and acetaminophen can be given for arthritis pain. Pathologic fractures, cardiac complications, osteosarcoma (up to 1%). Eighty percent of 1° cases are due to a single adenoma and 15% to parathyroid hyperplasia. The most common 2° cause is phosphate retention in chronic kidney disease, which leads to renal osteodystrophy. 3° hyperparathyroidism occurs when chronic 2° hyperparathyroidism progresses to an unregulated state, resulting in hypercalcemia. Most cases are asymptomatic, but signs and symptoms may be mild and include stones (nephrolithiasis), bones (bone pain, myalgias, arthralgias, fractures), abdominal groans (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, PUD, pancreatitis), and psychiatric overtones (fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances). Chronic renal insufficiency and gout are also associated with 1° hyperparathyroidism. Relative surgical criteria for hyperparathyroidism include age < 50, markedly ↓ bone mass, nephrolithiasis/renal insuff ciency, profoundly elevated serum calcium or life-threatening hypercalcemia, and urine calcium > 400 mg in 24 hours. Labs reveal hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercalciuria. Intact PTH is inappropriately ↑ relative to ionized calcium (see Table 2.3-5). Vitamin D deficiency may obscure mild cases. A radionuclide parathyroid scan may help with localization of an adenoma, although localization is not always necessary. Cancer is the most likely alternative diagnosis and must be ruled out, but with carcinoma PTH is usually < 25 pg/mL unless hyperparathyroidism is also present. Lithium and thiazides may exacerbate hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy if the patient is symptomatic or if certain criteria are met. For acute hypercalcemia, give IV fuids (with a loop diuretic in the setting of renal or heart failure), IV bisphosphonate, and calcitonin. Oral phosphate binders (aluminum hydroxide, calcium salts, sevelamer hydrochloride, and lanthanum carbonate) and dietary phosphate restriction are used in patients with 2° hyperparathyroidism regardless of dialysis status. Cinacalcet ↓ PTH as well as calcium and phosphate and may be a helpful adjunct in end-stage renal disease. Hypercalcemia is the most severe complication, presenting acutely with coma or altered mental status, bone disease, nephrolithiasis, and abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. The most common endogenous cause of Cushing’s syndrome is hypersecretion of ACTH from a pituitary adenoma (known as Cushing’s disease, or central hypercortisolism). Other endogenous causes include ectopic ACTH secretion from neoplasia (e.g., carcinoid tumor, small cell lung cancer) and excess adrenal secretion of cortisol (e.g., bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, adrenal cancer). The condition is most commonly iatrogenic, resulting from treatment with exogenous corticosteroids.', 'The type of treatment is based on the severity of the hypercalcemia and the nature of associated symptoms, as outlined below. PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM Natural History and Incidence Primary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder of calcium, phosphate, and bone metabolism due to an increased secretion of PTH. The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. There is great variation in the manifestations. Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorption. However, with greater awareness of the disease and wider use of multiphasic screening tests, including measurements of blood calcium, the diagnosis is frequently made in patients who have no symptoms and minimal, if any, signs of the disease other than hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH. The manifestations may be subtle, and the disease may have a benign course for many years or a lifetime. This milder form of the disease is usually termed asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. Rarely, hyperparathyroidism develops or worsens abruptly and causes severe complications such as marked dehydration and coma, so-called hypercalcemic parathyroid crisis. The annual incidence of the disease is calculated to be as high as 0.2% in patients >60, with an estimated prevalence, including undiscovered asymptomatic patients, of ≥1%; some reports suggest the incidence may be declining. If confirmed, these changing estimates may reflect less frequent routine testing of serum calcium in recent years, earlier overestimates in incidence, or unknown factors. The disease has a peak incidence between the third and fifth decades but occurs in young children and in the elderly. Etiology Parathyroid tumors are most often encountered as isolated adenomas without other endocrinopathy. They may also arise in hereditary syndromes such as MEN syndromes. Parathyroid tumors may also arise as secondary to underlying disease (excessive stimulation in secondary hyperparathyroidism, especially chronic renal failure) or after other forms of excessive stimulation such as lithium therapy. These etiologies are discussed below. Solitary adenomaS A single abnormal gland is the cause in ~80% of patients; the abnormality in the gland is usually a benign neoplasm or adenoma and rarely a parathyroid carcinoma. Some surgeons and pathologists report that the enlargement of multiple glands is common; double adenomas are reported. In ~15% of patients, all glands are hyperfunctioning; chief cell parathyroid hyperplasia is usually hereditary and frequently associated with other endocrine abnormalities. Hereditary SyndromeS and multiple paratHyroid tumorS Hereditary hyperparathyroidism can occur without other endocrine abnormalities but is usually part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome (Chap. 408). MEN 1 (Wermer’s syndrome) consists of hyperparathyroidism and tumors of the pituitary and pancreas, often associated with gastric hypersecretion and peptic ulcer disease (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). MEN 2A is characterized by pheochromocytoma and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, as well as hyperparathyroidism; MEN 2B has additional associated features such as multiple neuromas but usually lacks hyperparathyroidism. Each of these MEN syndromes is transmitted in an apparent autosomal dominant manner, although, as noted below, the genetic basis of MEN 1 involves biallelic loss of a tumor suppressor. The hyperparathyroidism jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome occurs in families with parathyroid tumors (sometimes carcinomas) in association with benign jaw tumors. This disorder is caused by mutations in CDC73 (HRPT2), and mutations in this gene are also observed in parathyroid cancers. Some kindreds exhibit hereditary hyperparathyroidism without other endocrinopathies. This disorder is often termed nonsyndromic familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP). There is speculation that these families may be examples of variable expression of the other syndromes such as MEN 1, MEN 2, or the HPT-JT syndrome, but they may also have distinctive, still unidentified genetic causes. Pathology Adenomas are most often located in the inferior parathyroid glands, but in 6–10% of patients, parathyroid adenomas may be located in the thymus, the thyroid, the pericardium, or behind the esophagus. Adenomas are usually 0.5–5 g in size but may be as large as 10–20 g (normal glands weigh 25 mg on average). Chief cells are predominant in both hyperplasia and adenoma. With chief cell hyperplasia, the enlargement may be so asymmetric that some involved glands appear grossly normal. If generalized hyperplasia is present, however, histologic examination reveals a uniform pattern of chief cells and disappearance of fat even in the absence of an increase in gland weight. Thus, microscopic examination of biopsy specimens of several glands is essential to interpret findings at surgery. Parathyroid carcinoma is often not aggressive. Long-term survival without recurrence is common if at initial surgery the entire gland is removed without rupture of the capsule. Recurrent parathyroid carcinoma is usually slow-growing with local spread in the neck, and surgical correction of recurrent disease may be feasible. Occasionally, however, parathyroid carcinoma is more aggressive, with distant metastases (lung, liver, and bone) found at the time of initial operation. It may be difficult to appreciate initially that a primary tumor is carcinoma; increased numbers of mitotic figures and increased fibrosis of the gland stroma may precede invasion. The diagnosis of carcinoma is often made in retrospect. Hyperparathyroidism from a parathyroid carcinoma may be indistinguishable from other forms of primary hyperparathyroidism but is usually more severe clinically. A potential clue to the diagnosis is offered by the degree of calcium elevation. Calcium values of 3.5–3.7 mmol/L (14–15 mg/dL) are frequent with carcinoma and may alert the surgeon to remove the abnormal gland with care to avoid capsular rupture. Recent findings concerning the genetic basis of parathyroid carcinoma (distinct from that of benign adenomas) indicate the need, in these kindreds, for family screening (see below). As in many other types of neoplasia, two fundamental types of genetic defects have been identified in parathyroid gland tumors: (1) overactivity of protooncogenes and (2) loss of function of tumor-suppressor genes. The former, by definition, can lead to uncontrolled cellular growth and function by activation (gain-of-function mutation) of a single allele of the responsible gene, whereas the latter requires loss of function of both allelic copies.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM Natural History and Incidence Primary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder of calcium, phosphate, and bone metabolism due to an increased secretion of PTH.

","['Spread of the tumor is typically to the lymph node chains that drain the testes. The testes develop from structures adjacent to the renal vessels in the upper abdomen, between the transversalis fascia and the peritoneum. They normally migrate through the inguinal canals into the scrotum just before birth. The testes take with them their arterial supply, their venous drainage, their nerve supply, and their lymphatics. A computed tomography scan revealed a para-aortic lymph node mass in the upper abdomen and enlarged lymph nodes throughout the internal and common iliac lymph node chains. Assuming the scrotal mass was a carcinoma of the testes, which would normally drain into the lateral aortic (lumbar) nodes in the upper abdomen, it would be very unusual for iliac lymphadenopathy to be present. Further examination of the scrotal mass was required. A transillumination test of the scrotum on the affected side was positive. An ultrasound scan revealed normal right and left testes and a large fluid collection around the right testis. A diagnosis of a right-sided hydrocele was made. Scrotal masses are common in young males, and determining the exact anatomical site of the scrotal mass is of utmost clinical importance. Any mass that arises from the testis should be investigated to exclude testicular cancer. Masses that arise from the epididymis and scrotal lesions, such as fluid (hydrocele) or hernias, are also clinically important but are not malignant. The ultrasound scan revealed fluid surrounding the testis, which is diagnostic of a hydrocele. Simple cysts arising from and around the epididymis (epididymal cysts) can be easily defined.

","['Headache is common, and strokes and cranial neuropathies may occur. Brain imaging studies may be normal or nonspecifically abnormal. CSF analysis reveals a mild pleocytosis or protein elevation. Cerebral angiography can show multifocal stenoses involving medium-caliber vessels, but some patients have only small-vessel disease that is not revealed on angiography. The angiographic appearance is not specific and may be mimicked by atherosclerosis, infection, or other causes of vascular disease. Brain or meningeal biopsy demonstrates endothelial cell proliferation and mononuclear infiltrates within blood vessel walls. The prognosis is often poor, although the disorder may remit spontaneously.', 'A careful neurologic examination is an essential first step in the evaluation. In most cases, patients with an abnormal examination or a history of recent-onset headache should be evaluated by a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. As an initial screening procedure for intracranial pathology in this setting, CT and MRI methods appear to be equally sensitive. In some circumstances, a lumbar puncture (LP) is also required, unless a benign etiology can be otherwise established.

The psychological state of the patient should also be evaluated because a relationship exists between head pain and depression. This is intended to identify comorbidity rather than provide an explanation for the headache, because troublesome headache is seldom simply caused by mood change. Although it is notable that medicines with antidepressant actions are also effective in the prophylactic treatment of both tension-type headache and migraine, each symptom must be treated optimally. Underlying recurrent headache disorders may be activated by pain that follows otologic or endodontic surgical procedures. Thus, pain about the head as the result of diseased tissue or trauma may reawaken an otherwise quiescent migraine syndrome. Treatment of the headache is largely ineffective until the cause of the primary problem is addressed. Serious underlying conditions that are associated with headache are described below. Brain tumor is a rare cause of headache and even less commonly a cause of severe pain. The vast majority of patients presenting with severe headache have a benign cause. The management of secondary headache focuses on diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition. Acute, severe headache with stiff neck and fever suggests meningitis. LP is mandatory. Often there is striking accentuation of pain with eye movement. Meningitis can be easily mistaken for migraine in that the cardinal symptoms of pounding headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting are frequently present, perhaps reflecting the underlying biology of some of the patients. Meningitis is discussed in Chaps. 164 and 165. Acute, severe headache with stiff neck but without fever suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage. A ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage may also present with headache alone.

","['B. Cardiovascular Effects\n\n\n\nKetamine can produce transient but significant increases in systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, presumably by centrally mediated sympathetic stimulation. These effects, which are associated with increased cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption, are not always desirable and can be blunted by coadministration of benzodiazepines, opioids, or inhaled anesthetics. Though the effect is more controversial, ketamine is also considered to be a direct myocardial depressant. This property is usually masked by its stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system but may become apparent in critically ill patients with limited ability to increase their sympathetic nervous system activity. C. Respiratory Effects\n\n\n\nKetamine is not thought to produce significant respiratory depression. When it is used as a single drug, the respiratory response to hypercapnia is preserved and blood gases remain stable. Transient hypoventilation and, in rare cases, a short period of apnea can follow rapid administration of a large intravenous dose for induction of anesthesia. The ability to protect the upper airway in the presence of ketamine cannot be assumed despite the presence of active airway reflexes. Especially in children, the risk for laryngospasm because of increased salivation must be considered; this risk can be reduced by premedication with an anticholinergic drug. Ketamine relaxes bronchial smooth muscle and may be helpful in patients with reactive airways and in the management of patients experiencing bronchoconstriction. Its unique properties, including profound analgesia, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, bronchodilation, and minimal respiratory depression, make ketamine an important alternative to the other intravenous anesthetics and a desirable adjunct in many cases despite the unpleasant psychotomimetic effects. Moreover, ketamine can be administered by multiple routes (intravenous, intramuscular, oral, rectal, epidural), thus making it a useful option for premedication in mentally challenged and uncooperative pediatric patients. Induction of anesthesia can be achieved with ketamine, 1–2 mg/kg intravenously or 4–6 mg/kg intramuscularly. Although the drug is not commonly used for maintenance of anesthesia, its short context-sensitive half-time makes ketamine a candidate for this purpose. For example, general anesthesia can be achieved with the infusion of ketamine, 15–45 mcg/kg/min, plus 50–70% nitrous oxide or by ketamine alone, 30–90 mcg/kg/min. Small bolus doses of ketamine (0.2–0.8 mg/kg IV) may be useful during regional anesthesia when additional analgesia is needed (eg, cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia with an insufficient regional block). Ketamine provides effective analgesia without compromise of the airway. An infusion of a subanalgesic dose of ketamine (3–5 mcg/kg/min) during general anesthesia and in the early postoperative period may be useful to produce analgesia or reduce opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. The use of ketamine has always been limited by its unpleasant psychotomimetic side effects, but its unique features make it a very valuable alternative in certain settings, mostly because of the potent analgesia with minimal respiratory depression. Most recently, it has become popular as an adjunct administered at sub-analgesic doses to limit or reverse opioid tolerance. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist. Recognition of the usefulness of α2 agonists is based on observations of decreased anesthetic requirements in patients receiving chronic clonidine therapy. The effects of dexmedetomidine can be antagonized with α2-antagonist drugs. Dexmedetomidine is the active S-enantiomer of medetomidine, a highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist imidazole derivative that is used in veterinary medicine. Dexmedetomidine is water soluble and available as a parenteral formulation. Dexmedetomidine undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism involving N-methylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation.

","['At a minimum, consideration needs to be given to questions of clinical validation, specimen stability, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values, analytic accuracy and precision, and relative costs. In the interpretation of clinical laboratory results, comparison is usually made to a reference range (sometimes called a normal range) that defines the values seen in health or considered to be desirable for health. Several common methods are used to describe reference ranges in the clinical laboratory. 1. For many quantitative clinical laboratory tests, the range of observed values in a healthy population shows an approximately Gaussian distribution. The factors that contribute to this range include the interand intraindividual variation in the concentration of the analyte and the analytic imprecision. When there is an approximately Gaussian distribution of values in the population, the reference range is commonly defined as being the central 95% of the range of distribution of those values. According to this method, 2.5% of the population will have a measured value that is below the reference range for the analyte, and 2.5% will have a value that is above the reference range. The fact that 5% of healthy individuals will have a test value that is outside the reference range has important implications when multiple tests are ordered. If N independent tests are performed on a specimen, then the probability that at least one result will be outside the reference range is (1–0.95N). The greater the number of tests ordered (even for a healthy individual), the greater is the likelihood of an abnormal result (Fig. 480e-1). If 20 independent tests are performed on a healthy subject, the probability of at least one abnormal result is almost two-thirds. In some settings, a narrower range of values is considered to be abnormal. For example, current American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of a serum level of cardiac troponins that is greater than the 99th percentile of values found in a healthy population as evidence of acute myocardial infarction.

","['A specimen of urine is obtained by catheter for determination of specific gravity and for glucose, acetone, and protein content. Proteinuria may also be found for 2 or 3 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage or with high fever. Urine of high specific gravity, glycosuria, and acetonuria occurs almost invariably in diabetic coma; but transient glycosuria and hyperglycemia may be precipitated solely by a massive cerebral lesion. Blood counts should be obtained and in malarial districts, a blood smear should be examined for parasites. Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs in bacterial infections and mild elevations of the white blood cell counts also with brain hemorrhage and infarction, although rarely exceeding 12,000/mm3. Venous blood should be examined for the concentrations of glucose, urea, carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, ammonia, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and AST (aspartate serum transaminase); analysis of blood gases and carboxyhemoglobin should be obtained in appropriate cases of anoxia or exposure to carbon monoxide by smoke inhalation or faulty heating systems. Determination of ammonia level may be added in instances where hepatic failure is a possible cause of stupor or coma. It should be kept in mind that disorders of water and sodium balance, reflected in hyperor hyponatremia, may be the result of cerebral disease (excess antidiuretic hormone [ADH] secretion, diabetes insipidus, atrial natriuretic factor release), as well as being the proximate cause of coma. An EEG is informative if no adequate explanation for coma is forthcoming from the initial examinations. At times, this is the only way to reveal nonconvulsive status epilepticus as the cause of stupor. Classification of Coma and Differential Diagnosis\n\n\n\nThe demonstration of focal brain disease by hemiparesis, and meningeal irritation with abnormalities of the CSF serve to divide the diseases that cause coma into three classes, as follows:\n\n\n\nI. Diseases that cause no focal or lateralizing neurologic signs, usually with normal brainstem functions. CT scan and cellular content of the CSF are normal.', 'On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly. The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1. This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine. The initial hypovolemia increased the sensitivity of this patient’s AVP response to osmolality, both decreasing the osmotic threshold for AVP release and increasing the slope of the osmolality response curve. AVP has a half-life of only 10–20 min; therefore, the acute increase in intravascular volume after a liter of intravenous saline led to a rapid reduction in circulating AVP. The ensuing water diuresis is the primary explanation for the rapid increase in plasma Na+ concentration in the first 7 h of her hospitalization. The key concern in this case was the evident chronicity of the patient’s hyponatremia, with several weeks of diarrhea followed by 2–3 days of acute exacerbation. This patient was judged to have chronic hyponatremia, i.e., with a suspected duration of >48 h; as such, she would be predisposed to osmotic demyelination were she to undergo too rapid a correction in her plasma Na+ concentration, i.e., by >8–10 meq/L in 24 h or 18 meq/L in 48 h. At presentation, she had no symptoms that one would typically attribute to acute hyponatremia, and the plasma Na+ concentration had already increased by a sufficient amount to protect from cerebral edema; however, she had corrected by 1 meq/L per hour within the first 7 h of admission, consistent with impending overcorrection. To reduce or halt the increase in plasma Na+ concentration, the patient received 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP along with intravenous free water. Given the hypovolemia and resolving acute renal insufficiency, a decision was made to administer half-normal saline as a source of free water, rather than D5W; this was switched to normal saline when plasma Na+ concentration acutely dropped to 117 meq/L (Table 64e-1). Overcorrection of chronic hyponatremia is a major risk factor for the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Animal studies show a neurologic and survival benefit in ODS of “re-lowering” plasma Na+ concentration with DDAVP and free water administration; this approach is demonstrably safe in patients with hyponatremia, with no evident risk of seizure or other sequelae. This combination can be used to prevent an overcorrection or to re-lower plasma Na+ concentration in patients who have already overcorrected. DDAVP is required because in most of these patients endogenous AVP levels have plummeted, resulting in a free water diuresis; the administration of free water alone has minimal effect in this setting, given the relative absence of circulating AVP. An alternative approach in patients who present with severe hyponatremia is to treat them\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 64e Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Acid-Base Disturbances: Case Examples ity, coadministering hypertonic saline to increase slowly the plasma Na+ con- centration in a more controlled fashion.

It is 64e-6 conceivable that residual hypovolemic hyponatremia attenuated the recovery of the plasma Na+ concentration. Alternatively, attenuated recovery was due to persistent effects of the single dose of DDAVP. Of note, although the plasma half-life of DDAVP is only 1–2 h, pharmacodynamic studies indicate a much more prolonged effect on urine output and/or urine osmolality. One final consideration is the effect of the patient’s initial renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the administered DDAVP, which is renally excreted; DDAVP should be administered with caution for the reinduction of hyponatremia in patients with chronic kidney disease or acute renal dysfunction.

Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available. Technically, a “diuretic” is an agent that increases urine volume, whereas a “natriuretic” causes an increase in renal sodium excretion and an “aquaretic” increases excretion of solute-free water. Because natriuretics almost always also increase water excretion, they are usually called diuretics. Osmotic diuretics and antidiuretic hormone antagonists (see Agents That Alter Water Excretion) are aquaretics and are not directly natriuretic. Most recently, an entirely new class of agents has been developed that block urea transport. These agents result in increased urine output and increased urea excretion but not increased excretion of electrolytes.

","['Diabetic Coma 1. Diabetic ketoacidosis—Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by inadequate or absent insulin replacement, which occurs in people with type 1 diabetes and infrequently in those with type 2 diabetes. It typically occurs in newly diagnosed type 1 patients or in those who have experienced interrupted insulin replacement, and rarely in people with type 2 diabetes who have concurrent unusually stressful conditions such as sepsis or pancreatitis or are on high-dose steroid therapy. DKA occurs more frequently in patients on insulin pumps. Poor compliance—either for psychological reasons or because of inadequate education—is one of the most common causes of DKA, particularly when episodes are recurrent. Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, deep slow (Kussmaul) breathing, change in mental status (including coma), elevated blood and urinary ketones and glucose, an arterial blood pH lower than 7.3, and low bicarbonate (15 mmol/L). The fundamental treatment for DKA includes aggressive intravenous hydration and insulin therapy and maintenance of potassium and other electrolyte levels. Fluid and insulin therapy is based on the patient’s individual needs and requires frequent reevaluation and modification. Close attention must be given to hydration and renal status, sodium and potassium levels, and the rate of correction of plasma glucose and plasma osmolality. Fluid therapy generally begins with normal saline. Regular human insulin should be used for intravenous therapy with a usual starting dosage of about 0.1 U/kg/h. 2. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome—Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) is diagnosed in persons with type 2 diabetes and is characterized by profound hyperglycemia and dehydration. It is associated with inadequate oral hydration, especially in elderly patients; with other illnesses; with the use of medication that elevates the blood sugar or causes dehydration, such as phenytoin, steroids, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers; and with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. The diagnostic hallmarks are declining mental status and even seizures, a plasma glucose >600 mg/dL, and a calculated serum osmolality >320 mmol/L. Persons with HHS are not acidotic unless DKA is also present. The treatment of HHS centers around aggressive rehydration and restoration of glucose and electrolyte homeostasis; the rate of correction of these variables must be monitored closely. Low-dose insulin therapy may be required. Chronic Complications of Diabetes\n\n\n\nLate clinical manifestations of diabetes mellitus include a number of pathologic changes that involve small and large blood vessels, cranial and peripheral nerves, the skin, and the lens of the eye. These lesions lead to hypertension, end-stage chronic kidney disease, blindness, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, amputations of the lower extremities, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accidents. These late manifestations correlate with the duration of the diabetic state subsequent to the onset of puberty and glycemic control. In type 1 diabetes, end-stage chronic kidney disease develops in up to 40% of patients, compared with less than 20% of patients with type 2 diabetes. Proliferative retinopathy ultimately develops in both types of diabetes but has a slightly higher prevalence in type 1 patients (25% after 15 years’ duration). In patients with type 1 diabetes, complications from end-stage chronic kidney disease are a major cause of death, whereas patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have macrovascular diseases leading to myocardial infarction and stroke as the main causes of death. Cigarette use adds significantly to the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications in diabetic patients. •Glipizide•Glyburide•Glimepiride•Gliclazide1 Insulin secretagogues: Close K+ channels in betacells•increaseinsulin release Reduce circulating glucose in patients with functioning beta cells Type 2 diabetes Orallyactive•duration10–24h•Toxicity: Hypoglycemia, weight gain •Tolazamide, tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, acetohexamide: Older sulfonylureas, lower potency, greater toxicity; rarely used •ColesevelamhydrochlorideBile acid binder: Lowers glucose through unknown mechanisms Reduces glucose levels Type 2 diabetes Oral•24-hdurationofaction•Toxicity: Constipation, indigestion, flatulence 1Not available in United States.

At presentation, she had no symptoms that one would typically attribute to acute hyponatremia, and the plasma Na+ concentration had already increased by a sufficient amount to protect from cerebral edema; however, she had corrected by 1 meq/L per hour within the first 7 h of admission, consistent with impending overcorrection. To reduce or halt the increase in plasma Na+ concentration, the patient received 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP along with intravenous free water. Given the hypovolemia and resolving acute renal insufficiency, a decision was made to administer half-normal saline as a source of free water, rather than D5W; this was switched to normal saline when plasma Na+ concentration acutely dropped to 117 meq/L (Table 64e-1). Overcorrection of chronic hyponatremia is a major risk factor for the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Animal studies show a neurologic and survival benefit in ODS of “re-lowering” plasma Na+ concentration with DDAVP and free water administration; this approach is demonstrably safe in patients with hyponatremia, with no evident risk of seizure or other sequelae. This combination can be used to prevent an overcorrection or to re-lower plasma Na+ concentration in patients who have already overcorrected. DDAVP is required because in most of these patients endogenous AVP levels have plummeted, resulting in a free water diuresis; the administration of free water alone has minimal effect in this setting, given the relative absence of circulating AVP. An alternative approach in patients who present with severe hyponatremia is to treat them\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 64e Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Acid-Base Disturbances: Case Examples ity, coadministering hypertonic saline to increase slowly the plasma Na+ con- centration in a more controlled fashion.

It is 64e-6 conceivable that residual hypovolemic hyponatremia attenuated the recovery of the plasma Na+ concentration. Alternatively, attenuated recovery was due to persistent effects of the single dose of DDAVP. Of note, although the plasma half-life of DDAVP is only 1–2 h, pharmacodynamic studies indicate a much more prolonged effect on urine output and/or urine osmolality. One final consideration is the effect of the patient’s initial renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the administered DDAVP, which is renally excreted; DDAVP should be administered with caution for the reinduction of hyponatremia in patients with chronic kidney disease or acute renal dysfunction.

","['In this condition, there is arterial vasoconstriction and secondary dilation of the capillaries and venules with resulting persistent cyanosis of the hands and, less frequently, the feet. Cyanosis may be intensified by exposure to a cold environment. Acrocyanosis may be categorized as primary or secondary to an underlying condition. In primary acrocyanosis, women are affected much more frequently than men, and the age of onset is usually <30 years. Generally, patients are asymptomatic but seek medical attention because of the discoloration. The prognosis is favorable, and pain, ulcers, and gangrene do not occur. Examination reveals normal pulses, peripheral cyanosis, and moist palms (Fig. 302-3B). Trophic skin changes and ulcerations do not occur. The disorder can be distinguished from Raynaud’s phenomenon because it is persistent and not episodic, the discoloration extends proximally from the digits, and blanching does not occur. Ischemia secondary to arterial occlusive disease can usually be excluded by the presence of normal pulses. Central cyanosis and decreased arterial oxygen saturation are not present. Patients should be reassured and advised to dress warmly and avoid cold exposure. Pharmacologic intervention is not indicated. Secondary acrocyanosis may result from hypoxemia, vasopressor medications, connective tissue diseases, atheroembolism, antiphospholipid antibodies, cold agglutinins, or cryoglobulins and is associated with anorexia nervosa and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Treatment should be directed at the underlying disorder.', 'Occasionally, autogenous or synthetic grafting is necessary to reestablish continuity of the artery and vein. Raynaud’s phenomenon is characterized by episodic digital ischemia, manifested clinically by the sequential development of digital blanching, cyanosis, and rubor of the fingers or toes after cold exposure\n\n\n\nArterial Diseases of the Extremities\n\n\n\nFIGURE 302-3 Vascular diseases associated with temperature: (A) Raynaud’s phenomenon; (B) acrocyanosis; (C) livedo reticularis; (D) pernio; (E) erythromelalgia; and (F) frostbite. and subsequent rewarming. Emotional stress may also precipitate Raynaud’s phenomenon. The color changes are usually well demarcated and are confined to the fingers or toes. Typically, one or more digits will appear white when the patient is exposed to a cold environment or touches a cold object (Fig. 302-3A). The blanching, or pallor, represents the ischemic phase of the phenomenon and results from vasospasm of digital arteries. During the ischemic phase, capillaries and venules dilate, and cyanosis results from the deoxygenated blood that is present in these vessels. A sensation of cold or numbness or paresthesia of the digits often accompanies the phases of pallor and cyanosis. With rewarming, the digital vasospasm resolves, and blood flow into the dilated arterioles and capillaries increases dramatically. This “reactive hyperemia” imparts a bright red color to the digits. In addition to rubor and warmth, patients often experience a throbbing, painful sensation during the hyperemic phase. Although the triphasic color response is typical of Raynaud’s phenomenon, some patients may develop only pallor and cyanosis; others may experience only cyanosis. Raynaud’s phenomenon is broadly separated into two categories: idiopathic, termed primary Raynaud’s phenomenon, and secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon, which is associated with other disease states or known causes of vasospasm (Table 302-1). Primary Raynaud’s Phenomenon This appellation is applied when the secondary causes of Raynaud’s phenomenon have been excluded. Over 50% of patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon have the primary form. Women are affected about five times more often than men, and the age of presentation is usually between 20 and 40 years. The fingers are involved more frequently than the toes. Initial episodes may involve only one or two fingertips, but subsequent attacks may involve the entire finger and may include all the fingers. The toes are affected in 40% of patients. Although vasospasm of the toes usually occurs in patients with symptoms in the fingers, it may happen alone. Rarely, the earlobes, the tip of the nose, and the penis are involved. Raynaud’s phenomenon occurs frequently in patients who also have migraine headaches or variant angina. These associations suggest that there may be a common predisposing cause for the vasospasm. Results of physical examination are often entirely normal; the radial, ulnar, and pedal pulses are normal.

Thickening and tightening of the digital subcutaneous tissue (sclerodactyly) develop in 10% of patients. Angiography of the digits for diagnostic purposes is not indicated. In general, patients with primary Raynaud’s disease have milder clinical manifestations. Fewer than 1% of these patients lose a part of a digit. After the diagnosis is made, the disease improves spontaneously in approximately 15% of patients and progresses in about 30%. Secondary Causes of Raynaud’s Phenomenon Raynaud’s phenomenon occurs in 80–90% of patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and is the presenting symptom in 30% (Chap. 382). It may be the only symptom of scleroderma for many years. Abnormalities of the digital vessels may contribute to the development of Raynaud’s phenomenon in this disorder. Ischemic fingertip ulcers may develop and progress to gangrene and autoamputation. About 20% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have Raynaud’s phenomenon (Chap. 378).']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['This disorder, characterized by episodic, painful blanching of the fingers and presumably caused by digital artery spasm, was first described by Raynaud in 1862.

The episodes are brought on by cold or emotional stress and are usually followed by redness on rewarming. Numbness, paresthesia, and burning often accompany the color changes.

Although the mechanism of this first-dose phenomenon is not clear, it occurs more commonly in patients who are saltand volume-depleted. Aside from the first-dose phenomenon, the reported toxicities of the α1 blockers are relatively infrequent and mild. These include dizziness, palpitations, headache, and lassitude. Some patients develop a positive test for antinuclear factor in serum while on prazosin therapy, but this has not been associated with rheumatic symptoms. The α1 blockers do not adversely and may even beneficially affect plasma lipid profiles, but this action has not been shown to confer any benefit on clinical outcomes. The nonselective agents, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, are useful in diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma and in other clinical situations associated with exaggerated release of catecholamines (eg, phentolamine may be combined with a β blocker to treat the clonidine withdrawal syndrome, described previously). Their pharmacology is described in Chapter 10. Mechanism & Sites of Action\n\n\n\nThis class of drugs includes the oral vasodilators, hydralazine and minoxidil, which are used for long-term outpatient therapy of hypertension; the parenteral vasodilators, nitroprusside and fenoldopam, which are used to treat hypertensive emergencies; the calcium channel blockers, which are used in both circumstances; and the nitrates, which are used mainly in ischemic heart disease but sometimes also in hypertensive emergencies (Table 11–3). Chapter 12 contains additional discussion of vasodilators. All the vasodilators that are useful in hypertension relax smooth muscle of arterioles, thereby decreasing systemic vascular resistance. Sodium nitroprusside and the nitrates also relax veins. Decreased arterial resistance and decreased mean arterial blood pressure elicit compensatory responses, mediated by baroreceptors and the sympathetic nervous system (Figure 11–4), as well as renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone. Because sympathetic reflexes are intact, vasodilator therapy does not cause orthostatic hypotension or sexual dysfunction. Vasodilators work best in combination with other antihypertensive drugs that oppose the compensatory cardiovascular responses. (See Box: Resistant Hypertension & Polypharmacy.)\n\n\n\nHydralazine, a hydrazine derivative, dilates arterioles but not veins. It has been available for many years, although it was initially thought not to be particularly effective because tachyphylaxis to its antihypertensive effects developed rapidly. The benefits of combination therapy are now recognized, and hydralazine may be used more effectively, particularly in severe hypertension. The combination of hydralazine with nitrates is effective in heart failure and should be considered in patients with both hypertension and heart failure, especially in African-American patients. Hydralazine is well absorbed and rapidly metabolized by the liver during the first pass, so that bioavailability is low (averaging 25%) and variable among individuals.

Metoprolol is approximately equipotent to propranolol in inhibiting stimulation of β1 adrenoceptors such as those in the heart but 50to 100-fold less potent than propranolol in blocking β2 receptors. Relative cardioselectivity is advantageous in treating hypertensive patients who also suffer from asthma, diabetes, or peripheral vascular disease. Although cardioselectivity is not complete, metoprolol causes less bronchial constriction than propranolol at doses that produce equal inhibition of β1-adrenoceptor responses. Metoprolol is extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 with high first-pass metabolism.

In ALL, prognosis is dependent on the genetic characteristics of the tumor, the patient’s age, the white cell count, and the patient’s overall clinical status and major organ function. In CLL, the patient evaluation should include a complete blood count, chemistry tests to measure major organ function, serum protein electrophoresis, and a bone marrow biopsy. However, some physicians believe that the diagnosis would not always require a bone marrow biopsy. Patients often have imaging studies of the chest and abdomen looking for pathologic lymphadenopathy. Patients with typical B-cell CLL can be subdivided into three major prognostic groups. Those patients with only blood and bone marrow involvement by leukemia but no lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, or signs of bone marrow failure have the best prognosis. Those with lymphadenopathy and organomegaly have an intermediate prognosis, and patients with bone marrow failure, defined as hemoglobin <100 g/L (10 g/dL) or platelet count <100,000/μL, have the worst prognosis. The pathogenesis of the anemia or thrombocytopenia is important to discern. The prognosis is adversely affected when either or both of these abnormalities are due to progressive marrow infiltration and loss of productive marrow. However, either or both may be due to autoimmune phenomena or to hypersplenism that can develop during the course of the disease. These destructive mechanisms are usually completely reversible (glucocorticoids for autoimmune disease; splenectomy for hypersplenism) and do not influence disease prognosis. Two popular staging systems have been developed to reflect these prognostic groupings (Table 134-7). Patients with typical B-cell CLL can have their course complicated by immunologic abnormalities, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia benefit from regular (monthly) γ globulin administration. Because of expense, γ globulin is often withheld until the patient experiences a significant infection.', 'Treatment? A 60-year-old African-American man presents with bone pain.

The prenatal history may reveal a maternal infection early in pregnancy (possibly teratogenic) or later in pregnancy (causing myocarditis or myocardial dysfunction in infants). Infants with heart failure exhibit poor growth, with weight being more significantly affected than height and head circumference. Heart failure may present with fatigue or diaphoresis with feeds or fussiness. Tachypnea without significant dyspnea may be present. Older children with heart failure may have easy fatigability, shortness of breath on exertion, and sometimes orthopnea. Not keeping up with other children during play or exercise is a sign of exercise intolerance. Heart failure may be misdiagnosed as recurrent pneumonia, bronchitis, wheezing, or asthma. A history of a heart murmur is important, but many wellchildren have an innocent murmur at some time in their lives. Other cardiac symptoms include cyanosis, palpitations, chest pain, syncope, and near-syncope. A review ofsystems assesses for possible systemic diseases or congenitalmalformation syndromes that may cause cardiac abnormalities (Tables 139-1 and 139-2). Current and past medication use as well as history of drug use, is important. Family history should be reviewed for hereditary diseases, early atherosclerotic heart disease, congenital heart disease, suddenunexplained deaths, thrombophilia, rheumatic fever, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

Inspection is supplemented by palpation and auscultation to provide a complete examination. The examination starts with vital signs.', '291e) and venous thromboembolism (Chap. 300) as well as for conditions that may predispose the patient to specific disorders. For example, a history of connective tissue diseases such as marfan syndrome should heighten the clinician’s suspicion of an acute aortic syndrome or spontaneous pneumothorax. A careful history may elicit clues about depression or prior panic attacks. In addition to providing an initial assessment of the patient’s clinical stability, the physical examination of patients with chest discomfort can provide direct evidence of specific etiologies of chest pain (e.g., unilateral absence of lung sounds) and can identify potential precipitants of acute cardiopulmonary causes of chest pain (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension), relevant comorbid conditions (e.g., obstructive pulmonary disease), and complications of the presenting syndrome (e.g., heart failure). However, because the findings on physical examination may be normal in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease, an unremarkable physical exam is not definitively reassuring. general The patient’s general appearance is helpful in establishing an initial impression of the severity of illness. Patients with acute MI or other acute cardiopulmonary disorders often appear anxious, uncomfortable, pale, cyanotic, or diaphoretic. Patients who are massaging or clutching their chests may describe their pain with a clenched fist held against the sternum (Levine’s sign). Occasionally, body habitus is helpful—e.g., in patients with Marfan syndrome or the prototypical young, tall, thin man with spontaneous pneumothorax.

Acute aortic emergencies usually present with severe hypertension but may be associated with profound hypotension when there is coronary arterial compromise or dissection into the pericardium. Sinus tachycardia is an important manifestation of submassive pulmonary embolism. Tachypnea and hypoxemia point toward a pulmonary cause. The presence of low-grade fever is nonspecific because it may occur with MI and with thromboembolism in addition to infection. Pulmonary Examination of the lungs may localize a primary pulmonary cause of chest discomfort, as in cases of pneumonia, asthma, or pneumothorax. Left ventricular dysfunction from severe ischemia/infarction as well as acute valvular complications of MI or aortic dissection can lead to pulmonary edema, which is an indicator of high risk.

","['tions back to 1966. Randomized controlled clinical trials include the careful prospective design features of the best observational data studies but also include the use of random allocation of treatment. This design provides the best protection against measured and unmeasured confounding due to treatment selection bias (a major aspect of internal validity). However, the randomized trial may not have good external validity (generalizability) if the process of recruitment into the trial resulted in the exclusion of many patients seen in clinical practice. Consumers of medical evidence need to be aware that randomized trials vary widely in their quality and applicability to practice. The process of designing such a trial often involves many compromises.', 'Subject and Observer Bias and Other Factors\n\n\n\nMost patients tend to respond in a positive way to any therapeutic intervention by interested, caring, and enthusiastic medical personnel. The manifestation of this phenomenon in the subject is the placebo response (Latin, “I shall please”) and may involve objective physiologic and biochemical changes as well as changes in subjective complaints associated with the disease. The placebo response is usually quantitated by administration of an inert material with exactly the same physical appearance, odor, consistency, etc, as the active dosage form. The magnitude of the response varies considerably from patient to patient and may also be influenced by the duration of the study. In some conditions, a positive response may be noted in as many as 30–40% of subjects given placebo. Placebo adverse effects and “toxicity” also occur but usually involve subjective effects: stomach upset, insomnia, sedation, and so on. Subject bias effects can be quantitated—and minimized relative to the response measured during active therapy—by the single-blind design. This involves use of a placebo as described above, administered to the same subjects in a crossover design, if possible, or to a separate control group of well-matched subjects. Observer bias can be taken into account by disguising the identity of the medication being used—placebo or active form—from both the subjects and the personnel evaluating the subjects’ responses (double-blind design). In this design, a third party holds the code identifying each medication packet, and the code is not broken until all the clinical data have been collected. Drug effects seen in clinical trials are obviously affected by the patient taking the drugs at the dose and frequency prescribed. In a recent phase 2 study, one third of the patients who said they were taking the drug were found by blood analysis to have not taken the drug. Confirmation of compliance with protocols (also known as adherence) is a necessary element to consider. The various types of studies and the conclusions that may be drawn from them are described in the accompanying text box. (See Box: Drug Studies—The Types of Evidence.)\n\n\n\nAs described in this chapter, drugs are studied in a variety of ways, from 30-minute test tube experiments with isolated enzymes and receptors to decades-long observations of popula-tions of patients. The conclusions that can be drawn from such different types of studies can be summarized as follows. Basic research is designed to answer specific, usually single, questions under tightly controlled laboratory conditions, eg, does drug x inhibit enzyme y? The basic question may then be extended, eg, if drug x inhibits enzyme y, what is the concentra-tion-response relationship? Such experiments are usually repro-ducible and often lead to reliable insights into the mechanism of the drug’s action. First-in-human studies include phase 1–3 trials. Once a drug receives FDA approval for use in humans, case reports and case series consist of observations by clinicians of the effects of drug (or other) treatments in one or more patients. These results often\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 Introduction: The Nature of Drugs & Drug Development & Regulation reveal unpredictable benefits and toxicities but do not gener-ally test a prespecified hypothesis and cannot prove cause and effect. Analytic epidemiologic studies consist of observations designed to test a specified hypothesis, eg, that thiazolidinedi-one antidiabetic drugs are associated with adverse cardiovascu-lar events. Cohort epidemiologic studies utilize populations of patients that have (exposed group) and have not (control group) been exposed to the agents under study and ask whether the exposed groups show a higher or lower incidence of the effect. Case-control epidemiologic studies utilize populations of patients that have displayed the end point under study and ask whether they have been exposed or not exposed to the drugs in question. Such epidemiologic studies add weight to conjectures but cannot control all confounding variables and therefore cannot conclusively prove cause and effect. Meta-analyses utilize rigorous evaluation and grouping of sim-ilar studies to increase the number of subjects studied and hence the statistical power of results obtained in multiple published studies. While the numbers may be dramatically increased by meta-analysis, the individual studies still suffer from their varying methods and end points, and a meta-analysis cannot prove cause and effect. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are designed to answer specific questions about the effects of medications on clinical end points or important surrogate end points, using large enough samples of patients and allocating them to con-trol and experimental treatments using rigorous randomization methods. Randomization is the best method for distributing all foreseen confounding factors, as well as unknown confounders, equally between the experimental and control groups. When properly carried out, such studies are rarely invalidated and are considered the gold standard in evaluating drugs.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['of Follow-Up.\u2002Attrition bias is the differences that occur between the groups when participants withdraw from the study.

Pos.', 'The age at the time of diagnosis is generally the third through fifth decade. Hypertension is usually mild to moderate but occasionally may be severe; primary aldosteronism should be considered in all patients with refractory hypertension. Hypertension in these patients may be associated with glucose intolerance. Most patients are asymptomatic; however, infrequently, polyuria, polydipsia, paresthesias, or muscle weakness may be present as a consequence of hypokalemic alkalosis. Although aldosterone is a salt-retaining hormone, patients with primary aldosteronism rarely have edema. Renal dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are strikingly increased in patients with primary aldosteronism compared to those with primary hypertension. In a hypertensive patient with unprovoked hypokalemia (i.e., unrelated to diuretics, vomiting, or diarrhea), the prevalence of primary aldosteronism approaches 40–50%. In patients on diuretics, serum potassium <3.1 mmol/L (<3.1 meq/L) also raises the possibility of primary aldosteronism; however, serum potassium is an insensitive and nonspecific screening test. Serum potassium is normal in ~25% of patients subsequently found to have an aldosterone-producing adenoma, and higher percentages of patients with other etiologies of primary aldosteronism are not hypokalemic. Additionally, hypokalemic hypertension may be a consequence of secondary aldosteronism, other mineralocorticoidand glucocorticoid-induced hypertensive disorders, and pheochromocytoma. The ratio of plasma aldosterone to plasma renin activity (PA/ PRA) is a useful screening test. These measurements preferably are obtained in ambulatory patients in the morning.

Mostpatientswithemphysemaalsohavesignsandsymptomsofconcurrentchronicbronchitis,sincecigarettesmokingisariskfactorforboth. http://ebooksmedicine.net\n\n\n\nChronic bronchitis is diagnosed on clinical grounds: it is defined by the presence of a persistent productive cough for at least 3 consecutive months in at least 2 consecutive years. It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD). The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways. Although the most important cause is cigarette smoking, other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, may contribute. These environmental irritants induce hypertrophy of mucous glands in the trachea and bronchi as well as an increase in mucin-secreting goblet cells in the epithelial surfaces of smaller bronchi and bronchioles. These irritants also cause inflammation marked by the infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In contrast with asthma, eosinophils are not seen in chronic bronchitis. Whereas the defining mucus hypersecretion is primarily a reflection of involvement of large bronchi, the airflow obstruction in chronic bronchitis results from (1) small airway disease, induced by mucous plugging of the bronchiolar lumen, inflammation, and bronchiolar wall fibrosis, and (2) coexistent emphysema. In general, while small airway disease (chronic bronchiolitis) is an important component of early, mild airflow obstruction, chronic bronchitis with significant airflow obstruction almost always is complicated by emphysema. It is postulated that many of the effects of environmental irritants on respiratory epithelium are mediated by local release of cytokines such as IL-13 from T cells and innate lymphoid cells. The transcription of the mucin gene in bronchial epithelium and the production of neutrophil elastase are increased as a consequence of exposure to tobacco smoke. Microbial infection often is present but has a secondary role, chiefly by maintaining inflammation and exacerbating symptoms.

Patients with chronic bronchitis and COPD have frequent exacerbations, more rapid disease progression, and poorer outcomes than those with emphysema alone. Progressive disease is marked by the development of pulmonary hypertension, sometimes leading to cardiac failure (Chapter 11); recurrent infections; and ultimately respiratory failure.

The hallmarks of asthma are intermittent, reversible airway obstruction; chronic bronchial inflammation with eosinophils; bronchial smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperreactivity; and increased mucus secretion. Sometimes trivial stimuli are sufficient to trigger attacks in patients, because of airway hyper-reactivity. Many cells play a role in the inflammatory response, in particular eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. Of note, asthma has increased in incidence significantly in the Western world over the past 4 decades. One explanation for this troubling trend is the hygiene hypothesis, according to which a lack of exposure to infectious organisms (and possibly nonpathogenic microorganisms as well) in early childhood results in defects in immune tolerance and subsequent hyperreactivity to immune stimuli later in life. Major factors contributing to the development of asthma include genetic predisposition to type I hypersensitivity (atopy), acute and chronic airway inflammation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to a variety of stimuli. Asthma may be subclassified as atopic (evidence of allergen sensitization) or nonatopic. In both types, episodes of bronchospasm may be triggered by diverse exposures, such as respiratory infections (especially viral), airborne irritants (e.g., smoke, fumes), cold air, stress, and exercise. There also are varying patterns of inflammation—eosinophilic (most common), neutrophilic, mixed inflammatory, and pauci-granulocytic—that are associated with differing etiologies, immunopathologies, and responses to treatment. The classic atopic form is associated with excessive type 2 helper T (TH2) cell activation. Cytokines produced by TH2 cells account for most of the features of atopic asthma— IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate IgE production, IL-5 activates eosinophils, and IL-13 also stimulates mucus production. IgE coats submucosal mast cells, which on exposure to allergen release their granule contents and secrete cytokines and other mediators. Mast cell–derived mediators produce two waves of reaction: an early (immediate) phase and a late phase (\n\n\n\nFig. 13.10\n\n\n\nThe early-phase reaction is dominated by bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, and vasodilation. Bronchoconstriction is triggered by mediators released from mast cells, including histamine, prostaglandin D2, and leukotrienes LTC4, D4, and E4, and also by reflex neural pathways. The late-phase reaction is inflammatory in nature. Inflammatory mediators stimulate epithelial cells to produce chemokines (including eotaxin, a potent chemoattractant and activator of eosinophils) that promote the recruitment of TH2 cells, eosinophils, and other leukocytes, thus amplifying an inflammatory reaction that is initiated by resident immune cells. • Repeated bouts of inflammation lead to structural changes in the bronchial wall that are collectively referred to as airway remodeling. These changes include hypertrophy of bronchial smooth muscle and mucus glands and increased vascularity and deposition of sub-epithelial collagen, which may occur as early as several years before initiation of symptoms. Asthma tends to “run” in families, but the role of genetics in asthma is complex. Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of genetic variants associated with asthma risk, some in genes enocding factors like the IL-4 receptor that are clearly involved in asthma pathogenesis. However, the precise contribution of asthma-associated genetic variants to the development of disease remains to be determined. This is the most common type of asthma and is a classic example of type I IgE–mediated hypersensitivity reaction (Chapter 5). It usually begins in childhood. A positive family history of atopy and/or asthma is common, and the onset of asthmatic attacks is often preceded by allergic rhinitis, urticaria, or eczema. Attacks may be triggered by allergens in dust, pollen, animal dander, or food, or by infections. A skin test with the offending antigen results in an immediate wheal-and-flare reaction. Atopic asthma also can be diagnosed based on serum radioallergosorbent tests (RASTs) that identify the presence of IgEs that recognize specific allergens. Patients with nonatopic forms of asthma do not have evidence of allergen sensitization, and skin test results usually are negative. A positive family history of asthma is less common. Respiratory infections due to viruses (e.g., rhino-virus, parainfluenza virus) and inhaled air pollutants (e.g., sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide) are common triggers. It is thought that virus-induced inflammation of the respiratory mucosa lowers the threshold of the subepithelial vagal receptors to irritants. Although the connections are not well understood, the ultimate humoral and cellular mediators of airway obstruction (e.g., eosinophils) are common to both atopic and nonatopic variants of asthma, so they are treated in a similar way. Several pharmacologic agents provoke asthma, aspirin being the most striking example. Patients with aspirin sensitivity present with recurrent rhinitis, nasal polyps, urticaria, and bronchospasm. The precise pathogenesis is unknown but is likely to involve some abnormality in prostaglandin metabolism stemming from inhibition of cyclooxygenase by aspirin. Occupational asthma may be triggered by fumes (epoxy resins, plastics), organic and chemical dusts (wood, cotton, platinum), gases (toluene), and other chemicals. Asthma attacks usually develop after repeated exposure to the inciting antigen(s). http://ebooksmedicine.net\n\n\n\nRelease of granules and mediators\n\n\n\nFig.13.10\u2003(AandB)Comparisonofanormalairwayandanairwayinvolvedbyasthma.Theasthmaticairwayismarkedbyaccumulationofmucusinthe\u2003bronchiallumensecondarytoanincreaseinthenumberofmucus-secretinggobletcellsinthemucosaandhypertrophyofsubmucosalglands;intensechronic\u2003inflammationduetorecruitmentofeosinophils,macrophages,andotherinflammatorycells;thickenedbasementmembrane;andhypertrophyandhyperplasia\u2003ofsmoothmusclecells.(C)Inhaledallergens(antigen)elicitaTH2-dominatedresponsefavoringIgEproductionandeosinophilrecruitment.(D)Onreexposure\u2003toantigen(Ag),theimmediatereactionistriggeredbyAg-inducedcross-linkingofIgEboundtoFcreceptorsonmastcells.Thesecellsreleasepreformed\u2003mediatorsthatdirectlyandvianeuronalreflexesinducebronchospasm,increasedvascularpermeability,mucusproduction,andrecruitmentofleukocytes.

In the usual case, attacks last from 1 to several hours and subside either spontaneously or with therapy.', 'Detailed questions should be asked about the onset and duration of symptoms and about changes in severity or rate of progression over time. Host factors and comorbid conditions may increase the risk of infection with certain organisms or of a more fulminant course than is usually seen. Lack of splenic function, alcoholism with significant liver disease, IV drug use, HIV infection, diabetes, malignancy, organ transplantation, and chemotherapy all predispose to specific infections and frequently to increased severity. The patient should be questioned about factors that might help identify a nidus for invasive infection, such as recent upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, or varicella; prior trauma; disruption of cutaneous barriers due to lacerations, burns, surgery, body piercing, or decubiti; and the presence of foreign bodies, such as nasal packing after rhinoplasty, tampons, or prosthetic joints. Travel, contact with pets or other animals, or activities that might result in tick or mosquito exposure can lead to diagnoses that would not otherwise be considered. Recent dietary intake, medication use, social or occupational contact with ill individuals, vaccination history, recent sexual contacts, and menstrual history may be relevant. A review of systems should focus on any neurologic signs or sensorium alterations, rashes or skin lesions, and focal pain or tenderness and should also include a general review of respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A complete physical examination should be performed, with special attention to several areas that are sometimes given short shrift in routine examinations. Assessment of the patient’s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient’s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection.

In addition to details about the sinuses and lungs, it is important to inquire about systemic manifestations and assess for physical findings of cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI), neurologic, dermatologic, and genitourinary involvement, all of which may give clues to specific diagnoses. Once the details from history and physical are teased out, laboratory testing (including measurements of blood eosinophils, cultures, and markers of inflammation), spirometry and radiographic imaging can help distinguish between different diseases.

","['Abnormal vital signs provide diagnostic clues and determine the need for acute intervention. Fever suggests inflammation or neoplasm. Orthostasis is found with significant blood loss, dehydration, sepsis, or autonomic neuropathy. Skin, eye, or joint findings may point to specific diagnoses. Neck exam with swallowing assessment evaluates dysphagia. Cardiopulmonary disease may present with abdominal pain or nausea; thus lung and cardiac exams are important. Pelvic examination tests for a gynecologic source of abdominal pain. Rectal exam may detect blood, indicating gut mucosal injury or neoplasm or a palpable inflammatory mass in appendicitis. Metabolic conditions and gut motor disorders have associated peripheral neuropathy. Inspection of the abdomen may reveal distention from obstruction, tumor, or ascites or vascular abnormalities with liver disease. Ecchymoses develop with severe pancreatitis. Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers. Laboratory, radiographic, and functional tests can assist in diagnosis of suspected GI disease. The GI tract also is amenable to internal evaluation with upper and lower endoscopy and to examination of luminal contents. Histopathologic exams of GI tissues complement these tests. Laboratory Selected laboratory tests facilitate the diagnosis of GI disease. Iron-deficiency anemia suggests mucosal blood loss, whereas vitamin B12 deficiency results from small-intestinal, gastric, or pancreatic disease. Either also can result from inadequate oral intake. Leukocytosis and increased sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels are found in inflammatory conditions, whereas leukopenia is seen in viremic illness. Severe vomiting or diarrhea elicits electrolyte disturbances, acid-base abnormalities, and elevated blood urea nitrogen. Pancreaticobiliary or liver disease is suggested by elevated pancreatic or liver chemistries. Thyroid chemistries, cortisol, and calcium levels are obtained to exclude endocrinologic causes of GI symptoms. Pregnancy testing is considered for women with unexplained nausea. Serologic tests can screen for celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatologic diseases like lupus or scleroderma, and paraneoplastic dysmotility syndromes.', 'The urinalysis may reveal the state of hydration or rule out severe renal disease, diabetes, or urinary infection. Blood urea nitrogen, glucose, and serum bilirubin levels may be helpful. Serum amylase levels may be increased by many diseases other than pancreatitis, e.g., perforated ulcer, strangulating intestinal obstruction, and acute cholecystitis; thus, elevations of serum amylase do not rule out the need for an operation. Plain and upright or lateral decubitus radiographs of the abdomen may be of value in cases of intestinal obstruction, perforated ulcer, and a variety of other conditions. They are usually unnecessary in patients with acute appendicitis or strangulated external hernias. In rare instances, barium or water-soluble contrast study of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract may demonstrate partial intestinal obstruction that may elude diagnosis by other means. If there is any question of obstruction of the colon, oral administration of barium sulfate should be avoided. On the other hand, in cases of suspected colonic obstruction (without perforation), a contrast enema may be diagnostic. In the absence of trauma, peritoneal lavage has been replaced as a diagnostic tool by CT scanning and laparoscopy. Ultrasonography has proved to be useful in detecting an enlarged gallbladder or pancreas, the presence of gallstones, an enlarged ovary, or a tubal pregnancy. Laparoscopy is especially helpful in diagnosing pelvic conditions, such as ovarian cysts, tubal pregnancies, salpingitis, and acute appendicitis. Radioisotopic hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scans (HIDAs) may help differentiate acute cholecystitis or biliary colic from acute pancreatitis. A CT scan may demonstrate an enlarged pancreas, ruptured spleen, or thickened colonic or appendiceal wall and streaking of the mesocolon or mesoappendix characteristic of diverticulitis or appendicitis. Sometimes, even under the best circumstances with all available aids and with the greatest of clinical skill, a definitive diagnosis cannot be established at the time of the initial examination. Nevertheless, even in the absence of a clear anatomic diagnosis, it may be abundantly clear to an experienced and thoughtful physician and surgeon that operation is indicated on clinical grounds alone. Should that decision be questionable, watchful waiting with repeated questioning and examination will often elucidate the true nature of the illness and indicate the proper course of action.

Langford\n\n\n\nA number of periarticular disorders have become increasingly common, due in part to greater participation in recreational sports by individuals of a wide range of ages. Periarticular disorders most commonly affect the knee or shoulder. With the exception of bursitis, hip pain is most often articular or is being referred from disease affecting anotherstructure (Chap 393).Thischapterdiscussessomeofthemore common periarticular disorders. Bursitis is inflammation ofabursa,whichisa thin-walledsaclinedwith synovial tissue. The function of the bursa is to facilitate movement of tendonsandmusclesoverbonyprominences.Excessivefrictionalforces from overuse, trauma, systemic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, gout), or infection may cause bursitis. Subacromial bursitis (subdeltoid bursitis) is the most common form of bursitis. The subacromial bursa, which is contiguous with the subdeltoid bursa, is located between the undersurface of the acromion and the humeral head and is covered by thedeltoidmuscle.Bursitisiscausedby repetitiveoverheadmotion and often accompanies rotator cuff tendinitis. Another frequently encountered form is trochanteric bursitis, which involves the bursa around the insertion of the gluteus medius onto the greater trochanter of the femur. Patients experience pain over the lateral aspect of the hip and upperthighand havetendernessoverthe posterioraspect of the greater trochanter. External rotation and resisted abduction of the hip elicit pain. Olecranon bursitis occurs over the posterior elbow, and when the area is acutely inflamed, infection or gout should be excluded by aspirating the bursa and performing a Gram stain and culture on the fluid aswellasexaminingthefluidforuratecrystals. Achilles bursitis involves the bursa located abovethe insertion of thetendon to the calcaneus and results from overuse and wearing tight shoes. Retrocalcaneal bursitis involves the bursa that is located between the calcaneus and posterior surface of the Achilles tendon. The pain is experienced at the back of the heel, and swelling appears on the medial and/or lateral side of the tendon. It occurs in association with spondyloarthritides, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, ortrauma. Ischial bursitis affects the bursa separating the gluteusmediusfromtheischialtuberosityanddevelopsfromprolonged sitting and pivoting on hard surfaces. Iliopsoas bursitis affects the bursa that lies between the iliopsoas muscle and hip joint and is lateral to the femoral vessels. Pain is experienced over this area and is made worse\n\n\n\nPeriarticular Disorders of the Extremities 2248 by hip extension and flexion. Anserine bursitis is an inflammation of the sartorius bursa located over the medial side of the tibia just below the knee and under the conjoint tendon and is manifested by pain on climbing stairs. Tenderness is present over the insertion of the conjoint tendon of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus. Prepatellar bursitis occurs in the bursa situated between the patella and overlying skin and is caused by kneeling on hard surfaces. Gout or infection may also occur at this site. Bursitis is typically diagnosed by history and physical examination, but visualization by ultrasound may play a useful role in selected instances for diagnosis and directed guidance of glucocorticoid injection. Treatment of bursitis consists of prevention of the aggravating situation, rest of the involved part, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) where appropriate for an individual patient, or local glucocorticoid injection. Tendinitis of the rotator cuff is the major cause of a painful shoulder andiscurrentlythoughttobecausedbyinflammationofthetendon(s). The rotator cuff consists of the tendons of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor muscles, and inserts on the humeral tuberosities. Of the tendons forming the rotator cuff, the supraspinatustendonis the most often affected,probablybecauseofits repeated impingement (impingement syndrome) between the humeral head and the undersurface of the anterior third of the acromion and coracoacromial ligament above as well as the reduction in its blood supply that occurs with abduction of the arm (Fig. 398-1).

Subacromial bursitis also accompanies this syndrome. Symptoms usually appear after injury or overuse, especially with activities involving elevation of the arm with some degree of forward flexion. Impingement syndrome occurs in persons participating in baseball, tennis, swimming, or occupations that require repeated elevation of the arm. Those over age 40 are particularly susceptible. Patients complain of a dull aching in the shoulder, which may interfere with sleep. Severe pain is experienced when the arm is actively abducted into an overhead position. The arc between 60° and 120° is especially painful. Tenderness is present over the lateral aspect of the humeral head just below the acromion. NSAIDs, local glucocorticoid injection, and physical therapy may relieve symptoms. Surgical decompression of the subacromial space may be necessary in patients refractory to conservative treatment.

","[""Liver tests have shortcomings. They can be normal in patients with serious liver disease and abnormal in patients with diseases that do not affect the liver. Liver tests rarely suggest a specific diagnosis; rather, they suggest a general category of liver disease, such as hepatocellular or cholestatic, which then further directs the evaluation. The liver carries out thousands of biochemical functions, most of which cannot be easily measured by blood tests. Laboratory tests measure only a limited number of these functions. In fact, many tests, such as the aminotransferases or alkaline phosphatase, do not measure liver function at all. Rather, they detect liver cell damage or interference with bile flow. Thus, no one test enables the clinician to accurately assess the liver’s total functional capacity. To increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of laboratory tests in the detection of liver disease, it is best to use them as a battery. Tests usually employed in clinical practice include the bilirubin, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time tests. When more than one of these tests provide abnormal findings or the findings are persistently abnormal on serial determinations, the probability of liver disease is high. When all test results are normal, the probability of missing occult liver disease is low. When evaluating patients with liver disorders, it is helpful to group these tests into general categories as outlined below. TESTS BASED ON DETOXIFICATION AND EXCRETORY FUNCTIONS Serum Bilirubin (See also Chap. 58) Bilirubin, a breakdown product of the porphyrin ring of heme-containing proteins, is found in the blood in two fractions—conjugated and unconjugated. The unconjugated fraction, also termed the indirect fraction, is insoluble in water and is bound to albumin in the blood. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin fraction is water soluble and can therefore be excreted by the kidney. When measured by modifications of the original van den Bergh method, normal values of total serum bilirubin are reported between 1 and 1.5 mg/dL with 95% of a normal population falling between 0.2 and 0.9 mg/dL. If the direct-acting fraction is less than 15% of the total, the bilirubin can be considered to all be indirect. The most frequently reported upper limit of normal for conjugated bilirubin is 0.3 mg/dL. Elevation of the unconjugated fraction of bilirubin is rarely due to liver disease. An isolated elevation of unconjugated bilirubin is seen primarily in hemolytic disorders and in a number of genetic conditions such as Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert’s syndromes (Chap. 58). Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin elevated but <15% direct) should prompt a workup for hemolysis (Fig. 358-1). In the absence of hemolysis, an isolated, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in an otherwise healthy patient can be attributed to Gilbert’s syndrome, and no further evaluation is required.

In contrast, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia almost always implies liver or biliary tract disease. The rate-limiting step in bilirubin metabolism is not conjugation of bilirubin, but rather the transport of conjugated bilirubin into the bile canaliculi. Thus, elevation of the conjugated fraction may be seen in any type of liver disease. In most liver diseases, both conjugated and unconjugated fractions of the bilirubin tend to be elevated. Except in the presence of a purely unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, fractionation of the bilirubin is rarely helpful in determining the cause of jaundice. Although the degree of elevation of the serum bilirubin has not been critically assessed as a prognostic marker, it is important in a number of conditions. In viral hepatitis, the higher the serum bilirubin, the greater is the hepatocellular damage. Total serum bilirubin correlates with poor outcomes in alcoholic hepatitis. It is also a critical component of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, a tool used to estimate survival of patients with end-stage liver disease and assess operative risk of patients with cirrhosis. An elevated total serum bilirubin in patients with drug-induced liver disease indicates more severe injury. Urine Bilirubin Unconjugated bilirubin always binds to albumin in the serum and is not filtered by the kidney. Therefore, any bilirubin found in the urine is conjugated bilirubin; the presence of bilirubinuria implies the presence of liver disease. A urine dipstick test can theoretically give the same information as fractionation of the serum bilirubin. This test is almost 100% accurate. Phenothiazines may give a false-positive reading with the Ictotest tablet. In patients recovering from jaundice, the urine bilirubin clears prior to the serum bilirubin. Blood Ammonia Ammonia is produced in the body during normal protein metabolism and by intestinal bacteria, primarily those in the colon. The liver plays a role in the detoxification of ammonia by converting it to urea, which is excreted by the kidneys. Striated muscle also plays a role in detoxification of ammonia, where it is combined with glutamic acid to form glutamine. Patients with advanced liver disease typically have significant muscle wasting, which likely contributes to hyperammonemia in these patients. Some physicians use the blood ammonia for detecting encephalopathy or for monitoring hepatic synthetic function, although its use for either of these indications has problems. There is very poor correlation between either the presence or the severity of acute encephalopathy and elevation of blood ammonia; it can be occasionally useful for identifying occult liver disease in patients with mental status changes. There is also a poor correlation of the blood serum ammonia and hepatic function. The ammonia can be elevated in patients with severe portal hypertension and portal blood shunting around the liver even in the presence of normal or near-normal hepatic function. Elevated arterial ammonia levels have been shown to correlate with outcome in fulminant hepatic failure. Serum Enzymes The liver contains thousands of enzymes, some of which are also present in the serum in very low concentrations. These enzymes have no known function in the serum and behave like other serum proteins. They are distributed in the plasma and in interstitial fluid and have characteristic half-lives, which are usually measured in days. Very little is known about the catabolism of serum enzymes, although they are probably cleared by cells in the reticuloendothelial system. The elevation of a given enzyme activity in the serum is thought to primarily reflect its increased rate of entrance into serum from damaged liver cells. Serum enzyme tests can be grouped into three categories: (1) enzymes whose elevation in serum reflects damage to hepatocytes, (2) enzymes whose elevation in serum reflects cholestasis, and (3) enzyme tests that do not fit precisely into either pattern. enzymes tHat reflect DamaGe to Hepatocytes The aminotransferases (transaminases) are sensitive indicators of liver cell injury and are most helpful in recognizing acute hepatocellular diseases such as hepatitis. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). AST is found in the liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in decreasing order of concentration. ALT is found primarily in the liver and is therefore a more specific indicator of liver injury. The aminotransferases are normally present in the serum in low concentrations. These enzymes are released into the blood in greater amounts when there is damage to the liver cell membrane resulting in increased permeability. Liver cell necrosis is not required for the release of the aminotransferases, and there is a poor correlation between the degree of liver cell damage and the level of the aminotransferases. Thus, the absolute elevation of the aminotransferases is of no prognostic significance in acute hepatocellular disorders. The normal range for aminotransferases varies widely among laboratories, but generally ranges from 10–40 IU/L. The interlaboratory variation in normal range is due to technical reasons; no reference standards exist to establish upper limits of normal for ALT and AST. Some have recommended revisions of normal limits of the aminotransferases to adjust for sex and body mass index, but others have noted the potential costs and unclear benefits of implementing this change. Any type of liver cell injury can cause modest elevations in the serum aminotransferases. Levels of up to 300 IU/L are nonspecific and may be found in any type of liver disorder. Minimal ALT elevations in asymptomatic blood donors rarely indicate severe liver disease; studies have shown that fatty liver disease is the most likely explanation. Striking elevations—i.e., aminotransferases >1000 IU/L—occur almost exclusively in disorders associated with extensive hepatocellular injury such as (1) viral hepatitis, (2) ischemic liver injury (prolonged hypo-tension or acute heart failure), or (3) toxinor drug-induced liver injury. The pattern of the aminotransferase elevation can be helpful diagnostically. In most acute hepatocellular disorders, the ALT is higher than or equal to the AST. Whereas the AST:ALT ratio is typically <1 in patients with chronic viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a number of groups have noted that as cirrhosis develops, this ratio rises to >1. An AST:ALT ratio >2:1 is suggestive, whereas a ratio >3:1 is highly suggestive, of alcoholic liver disease. The AST in alcoholic liver disease is rarely >300 IU/L, and the ALT is often normal. A low level of ALT in the serum is due to an alcohol-induced deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate. The aminotransferases are usually not greatly elevated in obstructive jaundice. One notable exception occurs during the acute phase of biliary obstruction caused by the passage of a gallstone into the common bile duct. In this setting, the aminotransferases can briefly be in the 1000– 2000 IU/L range. However, aminotransferase levels decrease quickly, and the liver function tests rapidly evolve into those typical of cholestasis. enzymes tHat reflect cHolestasis The activities of three enzymes— alkaline phosphatase, 5ʹ-nucleotidase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)—are usually elevated in cholestasis. Alkaline phosphatase and 5ʹ-nucleotidase are found in or near the bile canalicular membrane of 1997 hepatocytes, whereas GGT is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in bile duct epithelial cells. Reflecting its more diffuse localization in the liver, GGT elevation in serum is less specific for cholestasis than are elevations of alkaline phosphatase or 5ʹ-nucleotidase. Some have advocated the use of GGT to identify patients with occult alcohol use. Its lack of specificity makes its use in this setting questionable. The normal serum alkaline phosphatase consists of many distinct isoenzymes found in the liver; bone; placenta; and, less commonly, small intestine. Patients over age 60 can have a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase (1–1.5 times normal), whereas individuals with blood types O and B can have an elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase after eating a fatty meal due to the influx of intestinal alkaline phosphatase into the blood. It is also nonpathologically elevated in children and adolescents undergoing rapid bone growth because of bone alkaline phosphatase, and late in normal pregnancies due to the influx of placental alkaline phosphatase. Elevation of liver-derived alkaline phosphatase is not totally specific for cholestasis, and a less than threefold elevation can be seen in almost any type of liver disease. Alkaline phosphatase elevations greater than four times normal occur primarily in patients with cholestatic liver disorders, infiltrative liver diseases such as cancer and amyloidosis, and bone conditions characterized by rapid bone turnover (e.g., Paget’s disease). In bone diseases, the elevation is due to increased amounts of the bone isoenzymes. In liver diseases, the elevation is almost always due to increased amounts of the liver isoenzyme. If an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase is the only abnormal finding in an apparently healthy person, or if the degree of elevation is higher than expected in the clinical setting, identification of the source of elevated isoenzymes is helpful (Fig. 358-1)."", 'Often presents in young patients with liver damage and dyspnea without a history of smoking.

Complete excision of the cyst and the minor salivary gland constitutes definitive treatment. Bacterial sialadenitis is a common infection that most often involves the major salivary glands, particularly the submandibular glands. The most frequent pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. Duct obstruction by stones (sialolithiasis) is a common antecedent to infection; it may also be induced by impacted food debris or by edema consequent to injury. Dehydration and decreased secretory function can also predispose to bacterial invasion. Systemic dehydration, with decreased salivary secretions, may predispose to suppurative bacterial parotitis in older adult patients following major thoracic or abdominal surgery. Such obstruction and bacterial invasion lead to nonspecific inflammation of the affected glands that may be largely interstitial or, when induced by staphylococci or other pyogens, may be associated with suppurative necrosis and abscess formation. Autoimmune sialadenitis, better known as Sjögren syndrome, is discussed in Chapter 5. Despite their relatively simple morphology, the salivary glands give rise to at least 30 histologically distinct tumors (\n\n\n\nTable 15.1 ).', 'aureus.

Treatment needs to address the consequences and the causesof the vomiting. Dehydration must be treated with fluid resuscitation. This can be accomplished in most cases with oralfluid-electrolyte solutions, but intravenous (IV) fluids may berequired. Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected by appropriate choice of fluids. Underlying causes should be treatedwhen possible.', '55-3A). When this strategy is unrevealing, simple triage tests are often warranted to direct the choice of more complex investigations (Fig. 55-3B). The history, physical examination (Table 55-4), and routine blood studies should attempt to characterize the mechanism of diarrhea, identify diagnostically helpful associations, and assess the patient’s fluid/electrolyte and nutritional status. Patients should be questioned about the onset, duration, pattern, aggravating (especially diet) and relieving factors, and stool characteristics of their diarrhea. The presence or absence of fecal incontinence, fever, weight loss, pain, certain exposures (travel, medications, contacts with diarrhea), and common extraintestinal manifestations (skin changes, arthralgias, oral aphthous ulcers) should be noted. A family history of IBD or sprue may indicate those possibilities. Physical findings may offer clues such as a thyroid mass, wheezing, heart murmurs, edema, hepatomegaly, abdominal masses, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous abnormalities, perianal fistulas, or anal sphincter laxity. Peripheral blood leukocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein suggests inflammation; anemia reflects blood loss or nutritional deficiencies; or eosinophilia may occur with parasitoses, neoplasia, collagen-vascular disease, allergy, or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Blood chemistries may demonstrate electrolyte, hepatic, or other metabolic disturbances. Measuring IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies may help detect celiac disease. Bile acid diarrhea is confirmed by a scintigraphic radiolabeled bile acid retention test; however, this is not available in many countries. Alternative approaches are a screening blood test (serum C4 or FGF-19), measurement of fecal bile acids, or a therapeutic trial with a bile acid sequestrant (e.g., cholestyramine or colesevelam). A therapeutic trial is often appropriate, definitive, and highly cost-effective when a specific diagnosis is suggested on the initial physician encounter. For example, chronic watery diarrhea, which ceases with fasting in an otherwise healthy young adult, may justify a trial of a lactose-restricted diet; bloating and diarrhea persisting since a mountain backpacking trip may warrant a trial of metronidazole for likely giardiasis; and postprandial diarrhea persisting following resection of terminal ileum might be due to bile acid malabsorption and be treated with cholestyramine or colesevelam before further evaluation. Persistent symptoms require additional investigation. Certain diagnoses may be suggested on the initial encounter (e.g., idiopathic IBD); however, additional focused evaluations may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and characterize the severity or extent of disease so that treatment can be best guided. Patients suspected of having IBS should be initially evaluated with flexible sigmoidoscopy with colorectal biopsies to exclude IBD, or particularly microscopic colitis, which is clinically indistinguishable from IBS with diarrhea; those with normal findings might be reassured and, as indicated, treated empirically with antispasmodics, antidiarrheals, or antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic agents). Any patient who presents with chronic diarrhea and hematochezia should be evaluated with stool microbiologic studies and colonoscopy.

","['Ebach 17\n\n\n\nAfter identifying the major gastrointestinal (GI) symptom, onset and progression should be determined (improved, unchanged, worsening). Characterization of signs and symptoms should identify factors such as triggers; actions that alleviate the symptom; timing, frequency and duration of symptoms; relationship to meals and defecation; and associated symptoms (e.g., fever or weight loss). Other key history includes exposures to others (family, school contacts), travel, environmental exposure, and impact of illness on the child (school absences). The history may suggest a diagnosis and direct the evaluation, which should include a full examination as well as a thorough abdominal examination. Extraintestinal disorders may produce GI manifestations (e.g., emesis with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, abdominal pain with lower lobe pneumonia). The examination should begin with a careful external inspection for abdominal distention, bruising or discoloration, abnormal veins, jaundice, surgical scars, and ostomies. Abnormalities of intensity and pitch of bowel sounds can occur with bowel obstruction. When palpating for tenderness, the examiner should note location, facial expression, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Palpation can also detect enlargement of the liver or spleen as well as feces and masses. If detected, organomegaly should be measured (with a tape measure), noting abnormal firmness or contour. A rectal examination, including inspection for fissures, skin tags, abscesses, and fistulous openings, should be performed for children with history suggesting constipation, GI bleeding, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Digital rectal examination should include assessment of anal sphincter tone, anal canal size and elasticity, tenderness, extrinsic masses, presence of fecal impaction, and caliber of the rectum. Stool should be tested for occult blood. A complete blood count may provide evidence for inflammation (white blood cell [WBC] and platelet count), poornutrition or bleeding (hemoglobin, red blood cell volume, reticulocyte count), and infection (WBC number and differential, presence of toxic granulation). Serum electrolytes, bloodurea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine help define hydration status. Tests of liver dysfunction include total and direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase for evidence of hepatocellular injury, and γ-glutamyltransferase oralkaline phosphatase for evidence of bile duct injury. Hepatic synthetic function can be assessed by coagulation factor levels,prothrombin time, and albumin level. Pancreatic enzyme tests (amylase, lipase) provide evidence of pancreatic injury or inflammation. Urinalysis can gauge dehydration and identify a possible source of protein loss.', 'Is there an abdominal mass or tenderness? 4. Are there any abnormalities of rectal mucosa, rectal defects, or altered anal sphincter functions? 5. Are there any mucocutaneous manifestations of systemic disease such as dermatitis herpetiformis (celiac disease), erythema nodosum (ulcerative colitis), flushing (carcinoid), or oral ulcers for IBD or celiac disease? pH, occult blood testing, leukocyte inspection (or leukocyte protein assay), fat quantitation, and laxative screens. For secretory diarrheas (watery, normal osmotic gap), possible medication-related side effects or surreptitious laxative use should be reconsidered. Microbiologic studies should be done including fecal bacterial cultures (including media for Aeromonas and Plesiomonas), inspection for ova and parasites, and Giardia antigen assay (the most sensitive test for giardiasis). Small-bowel bacterial overgrowth can be excluded by intestinal aspirates with quantitative cultures or with glucose or lactulose breath tests involving measurement of breath hydrogen, methane, or other metabolite. However, interpretation of these breath tests may be confounded by disturbances of intestinal transit. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies and small-bowel x-rays (formerly barium, but increasingly CT with enterography or magnetic resonance with enteroclysis) are helpful to rule out structural or occult inflammatory disease. When suggested by history or other findings, screens for peptide hormones should be pursued (e.g., serum gastrin, VIP, calcitonin, and thyroid hormone/thyroid-stimulating hormone, urinary 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, histamine). Further evaluation of osmotic diarrhea should include tests for lactose intolerance and magnesium ingestion, the two most common causes. Low fecal pH suggests carbohydrate malabsorption; lactose malabsorption can be confirmed by lactose breath testing or by a therapeutic trial with lactose exclusion and observation of the effect of lactose challenge (e.g., a liter of milk). Lactase determination on small-bowel biopsy is not generally available. If fecal magnesium or laxative levels are elevated, inadvertent or surreptitious ingestion should be considered and psychiatric help should be sought. For those with proven fatty diarrhea, endoscopy with small-bowel biopsy (including aspiration for Giardia and quantitative cultures) should be performed; if this procedure is unrevealing, a small-bowel radiograph is often an appropriate next step. If small-bowel studies are negative or if pancreatic disease is suspected, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency should be excluded with direct tests, such as the secretin-cholecystokinin stimulation test or a variation that could be performed endoscopically. In general, indirect tests such as assay of fecal elastase or chymotrypsin activity or a bentiromide test have fallen out of favor because of low sensitivity and specificity. Chronic inflammatory-type diarrheas should be suspected by the presence of blood or leukocytes in the stool. Such findings warrant stool cultures; inspection for ova and parasites; C. difficile toxin assay; colonoscopy with biopsies; and, if indicated, small-bowel contrast studies. Treatment of chronic diarrhea depends on the specific etiology and may be curative, suppressive, or empirical. If the cause can be eradicated, treatment is curative as with resection of a colorectal cancer, antibiotic administration for Whipple’s disease or tropical sprue, or discontinuation of a drug. For many chronic conditions, diarrhea can be controlled by suppression of the underlying mechanism. Examples include elimination of dietary lactose for lactase deficiency or gluten for celiac sprue, use of glucocorticoids or other anti-inflammatory agents for idiopathic IBDs, bile acid sequestrants for bile acid malabsorption, PPIs for the gastric hypersecretion of gastrinomas, somatostatin analogues such as octreotide for malignant carcinoid syndrome, prostaglandin inhibitors such as indomethacin for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, and pancreatic enzyme replacement for pancreatic insufficiency. When the specific cause or mechanism of chronic diarrhea evades diagnosis, empirical therapy may be beneficial. Mild opiates, such as diphenoxylate or loperamide, are often helpful in mild or moderate watery diarrhea. For those with more severe diarrhea, codeine or tincture of opium may be beneficial. Such antimotility agents should be avoided with severe IBD, because toxic megacolon may be precipitated. Clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, may allow control of diabetic diarrhea, although the medication may be poorly tolerated because it causes postural hypotension. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g., alosetron) may relieve diarrhea and urgency in patients with IBS diarrhea. For all patients with chronic diarrhea, fluid and electrolyte repletion is an important component of management (see “Acute Diarrhea,” earlier). Replacement of fat-soluble vitamins may also be necessary in patients with chronic steatorrhea. PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases\n\n\n\nConstipation is a common complaint in clinical practice and usually refers to persistent, difficult, infrequent, or seemingly incomplete defecation. Because of the wide range of normal bowel habits, constipation is difficult to define precisely. Most persons have at least three bowel movements per week; however, low stool frequency alone is not the sole criterion for the diagnosis of constipation. Many constipated patients have a normal frequency of defecation but complain of excessive straining, hard stools, lower abdominal fullness, or a sense of incomplete evacuation. The individual patient’s symptoms must be analyzed in detail to ascertain what is meant by “constipation” or “difficulty” with defecation. Stool form and consistency are well correlated with the time elapsed from the preceding defecation. Hard, pellety stools occur with slow transit, whereas loose, watery stools are associated with rapid transit. Both small pellety or very large stools are more difficult to expel than normal stools. The perception of hard stools or excessive straining is more difficult to assess objectively, and the need for enemas or digital disimpaction is a clinically useful way to corroborate the patient’s perceptions of difficult defecation. Psychosocial or cultural factors may also be important. A person whose parents attached great importance to daily defecation will become greatly concerned when he or she misses a daily bowel movement; some children withhold stool to gain attention or because of fear of pain from anal irritation; and some adults habitually ignore or delay the call to have a bowel movement. Pathophysiologically, chronic constipation generally results from inadequate fiber or fluid intake or from disordered colonic transit or anorectal function. These result from neurogastroenterologic disturbance, certain drugs, advancing age, or in association with a large number of systemic diseases that affect the GI tract (Table 55-5). Constipation of recent onset may be a symptom of significant organic disease such as tumor or stricture. In idiopathic constipation, a subset of patients exhibit delayed emptying of the ascending and transverse colon with prolongation of transit (often in the proximal colon) and a reduced frequency of propulsive HAPCs. Outlet obstruction to defecation (also called evacuation disorders) accounts for about a quarter of cases presenting with constipation in tertiary care and may cause delayed colonic transit, which is usually corrected by biofeedback retraining of the disordered defecation. Constipation of any cause may be exacerbated by hospitalization or chronic illnesses that lead to physical or mental impairment and result in inactivity or physical immobility. Types of Constipation and Causes Examples\n\n\n\nColonic obstruction Neoplasm; stricture: ischemic, diverticular, inflammatory Anal sphincter spasm Anal fissure, painful hemorrhoids Medications\n\n\n\nDisorders of rectal evacuation\n\n\n\nConstipation-predominant, alternating Ca2+ blockers, antidepressants Slow-transit constipation, megacolon (rare Hirschsprung’s, Chagas’ diseases) Pelvic floor dysfunction; anismus; descending perineum syndrome; rectal mucosal prolapse; rectocele Hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, pregnancy Depression, eating disorders, drugs Parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, spinal\n\n\n\nAPPROACH TO THE PATIENT:\n\n\n\nA careful history should explore the patient’s symptoms and confirm whether he or she is indeed constipated based on frequency (e.g., fewer than three bowel movements per week), consistency (lumpy/hard), excessive straining, prolonged defecation time, or need to support the perineum or digitate the anorectum to facilitate stool evacuation. In the vast majority of cases (probably >90%), there is no underlying cause (e.g., cancer, depression, or hypothyroidism), and constipation responds to ample hydration, exercise, and supplementation of dietary fiber (15–25 g/d). A good diet and medication history and attention to psychosocial issues are key. Physical examination and, particularly, a rectal examination should exclude fecal impaction and most of the important diseases that present with constipation and possibly indicate features suggesting an evacuation disorder (e.g., high anal sphincter tone, failure of perineal descent, or paradoxical puborectalis contraction during straining to simulate stool evacuation). The presence of weight loss, rectal bleeding, or anemia with constipation mandates either flexible sigmoidoscopy plus barium enema or colonoscopy alone, particularly in patients >40 years, to exclude structural diseases such as cancer or strictures. Colonoscopy alone is most cost-effective in this setting because it provides an opportunity to biopsy mucosal lesions, perform polypectomy, or dilate strictures. Barium enema has advantages over colonoscopy in the patient with isolated constipation because it is less costly and identifies colonic dilation and all significant mucosal lesions or strictures that are likely to present with constipation. Melanosis coli, or pigmentation of the colon mucosa, indicates the use of anthraquinone laxatives such as cascara or senna; however, this is usually apparent from a careful history. An unexpected disorder such as megacolon or cathartic colon may also be detected by colonic radiographs. Measurement of serum calcium, potassium, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels will identify rare patients with metabolic disorders. Patients with more troublesome constipation may not respond to fiber alone and may be helped by a bowel-training regimen, which involves taking an osmotic laxative (e.g., magnesium salts, lactulose, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol) and evacuating with enema or suppository (e.g., glycerine or bisacodyl) as needed. After breakfast, a distraction-free 15–20 min on the toilet without straining is encouraged. Excessive straining may lead to development of hemorrhoids, and, if there is weakness of the pelvic floor or injury to the pudendal nerve, may result in obstructed defecation from descending perineum syndrome several years later. Those few who do not benefit from the simple measures delineated above or require long-term treatment or fail to respond to potent laxatives should undergo further investigation (Fig.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Diagnostic Evaluation In view of the poor predictive value of abdominal pain for the presence of a gastroduodenal ulcer and the multiple disease processes that can mimic this disease, the clinician is often confronted with having to establish the presence of an ulcer. Documentation of an ulcer requires either a radiographic (barium study) or an endoscopic procedure. However, a large percentage of patients with symptoms suggestive of an ulcer have NUD; testing for H. pylori and antibiotic therapy (see below) is appropriate for individuals who are otherwise healthy and <45 years of age, before embarking on a diagnostic evaluation (Chap. 54).\n\n\n\nFIGURE 348-10 Barium study demonstrating (A) a benign duodenal ulcer and (B) a benign gastric ulcer.', 'dIAgNoSTIC TESTINg: MEASURES oF TEST ACCURACY\n\n\n\nThe purpose of performing a test on a patient is to reduce uncertainty about the patient’s diagnosis or prognosis in order to facilitate optimal management. Although diagnostic tests commonly are thought of as laboratory tests (e.g., blood count) or procedures (e.g., colonoscopy or bronchoscopy), any technology that changes a physician’s understanding of the patient’s problem qualifies as a diagnostic test. Thus, even the history and physical examination can be considered a form of diagnostic test. In clinical medicine, it is common to reduce the results of a test to a dichotomous outcome, such as positive or negative, normal or abnormal. Although this simplification ignores useful information (such as the degree of abnormality), such simplification does make it easier to demonstrate the fundamental principles of test interpretation discussed below.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0

Shining a light over this area shows that the scrotum does not transilluminate. Which of the following statements is true about the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A:Equally common on both sides
B:More common on left due to drainage into inferior vena cava
C:More common on left due to drainage into renal vein
D:More common on right due to drainage into inferior vena cava

","['The patient underwent chemotherapy and 2 years later is in full remission and leads an active life. A 35-year-old man had a soft mass approximately 3\u202fcm in diameter in the right scrotum. The diagnosis was a right indirect inguinal hernia. What were the examination findings? The mass was not tender and the physician was not able to “get above it.” The testes were felt separate from the mass, and a transillumination test (in which a bright light is placed behind the scrotum and the scrotal sac is viewed from the front) was negative. (A positive test occurs when the light penetrates through the scrotum.)\n\n\n\nWhen the patient stood up, a positive cough “impulse” was felt within the mass. After careful and delicate maneuvering, the mass could be massaged into the inguinal canal, so emptying from the scrotum.', 'When the massaging hand was removed, the mass recurred in the scrotum. An indirect inguinal hernia enters the inguinal canal through the deep inguinal ring. It passes through the inguinal canal to exit through the superficial inguinal ring in the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. The hernia sac lies superior and medial to the pubic tubercle and enters into the scrotum within the spermatic cord. A direct inguinal hernia passes directly through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. It does not pass down the inguinal canal. If large enough, it may pass through the superficial inguinal ring and into the scrotum. A 25-year-old man developed severe pain in the left lower quadrant of his abdomen. The pain was diffuse and relatively constant but did ease for short periods of time. On direct questioning the patient indicated that the pain was in the inguinal region and radiated posteriorly into his left infrascapular region (loin). A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient’s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief. The pain is referred. The visceral afferent (sensory) nerve fibers from the ureter pass into the spinal cord, entering the first and second lumbar segments of the spinal cord. Pain is thus referred to cutaneous regions innervated by somatic sensory nerves from the same spinal cord levels. The patient was investigated by a CT scan. Traditionally, a plain radiograph was used to look for the radiopaque stone (90% of renal stones are radiopaque) and this often proceeded to intravenous urography to determine precise location of renal stones. Currently, low-dose CT of the collecting system is used to visualize the renal stones and pinpoint the level of obstruction, using low radiation dose and no intravenous contrast. An ultrasound scan may also be useful to assess for pelvicaliceal dilation and may reveal stones at the pelviureteral junction or the vesicoureteric junction. Ultrasound is also valuable for assessing other causes of obstruction (e.g., tumors at and around the ureteric orifices in the bladder) and is particularly useful in pregnant women when imaging with the use of radiation is a concern. Usually an intravenous urogram would be carried out to enable assessment of the upper urinary tracts and precise location of the stone. Not infrequently, CT scans of the abdomen are also obtained. These scans not only give information about the kidneys, ureters, and bladder but also show the position of the stone and other associated pathology. If this patient’s infrascapular pain was on the right and predominantly within the right lower abdomen, appendicitis would also have to be excluded. A CT scan would enable differentiation of appendicitis and urinary colic. A 27-year-old woman was admitted to the surgical ward with appendicitis. She underwent an appendectomy. It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures. This patient had developed an intraabdominal abscess. Any operation on the bowel may involve peritoneal contamination with fecal contents and fecal flora. This may not be appreciated at the time of the operation. Over the postoperative period an inflammatory reaction ensued and an abscess cavity developed, filling with pus. Typically, the observation chart revealed a “swinging” pyrexia (fever). The most common sites for abscess to develop are the pelvis and the hepatorenal recess. When a patient is in the supine position, the lowest points in the abdominal and pelvic cavities are the posterior superior aspect of the peritoneal cavity (the hepatorenal recess) and, in women, the recto-uterine pouch (pouch of Douglas). The shoulder pain suggested that the abscess was in the hepatorenal recess and that the pain was referred from the diaphragm. The motor and sensory innervation of the diaphragm is from nerves C3 to C5. The somatic pain sensation from the parietal peritoneum covering the undersurface of the diaphragm is carried into the spinal cord by the phrenic nerve (C3 to C5) and is interpreted by the brain as coming from skin over the shoulder—a region supplied by other somatic sensory nerves entering the same levels of the spinal cord as those from the diaphragm. A chest radiograph demonstrated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. This elevation of the right hemidiaphragm was due to the pus tracking from the hepatorenal space around the lateral and anterior aspect of the liver to sit on top of the liver in a subphrenic position. An ultrasound scan demonstrated this collection of fluid. The abscess cavity could be clearly seen by placing the ultrasound probe between ribs XI and XII. The inferior border of the right lower lobe lies at rib X in the midaxillary line. When the probe is placed between ribs XI and XII the ultrasound waves pass between the intercostal muscles and the parietal pleura laterally on the chest wall, and continue through the parietal pleura overlying the diaphragm into the cavity of the abscess, which lies below the diaphragm. Drainage was not done by an intercostal route. Instead, using CT guidance and local anesthesia, a subcostal drain was established and 1 liter of pus was removed (eFig. 4.188). It is important to bear in mind that placing a drain through the pleural cavity into the abdominal cavity effectively allows intraabdominal pus to pass into the thoracic cavity, and that this may produce an empyema (pus in the pleural space). The patient made a slow and uneventful recovery.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['C. Presents in adolescents with sudden testicular pain and absent cremasteric reflex\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nA.

"A 34-year-old man was brought into the emergency room after he was found running in the streets. Upon arrival to the emergency room, he keeps screaming, “they are eating me alive,"" and swatting his hands. He reports that there are spiders crawling all over him.

","['The patient is assailed by a sense of strangeness, as though his body had changed or the surroundings were unreal. He is frightened, sometimes by the prospect of imminent death (angor animi) or of losing his mind or self-control. There may be a feeling of smothering. “I am dying” or “I can’t breathe” are characteristic expressions of alarm and panic. The heart races, breathing comes in rapid gasps, the pupils may be dilated, and the patient may sweat or tremble. The palpitation and breathing difficulties are so prominent that a cardiologist is often consulted. Some of our psychiatric colleagues identify breathlessness or a suffocating feeling as central to the diagnosis of panic (and attribute psychologic meaning to the symptom), but this is not sustained in our observations of affected patients. The symptoms abate spontaneously after 15 to 30 min, leaving the patient shaken, tense, perplexed, and often embarrassed. There is no confusion, and after the episode there is full memory of the event. Most anxiety attacks are of lesser severity with complaints of apprehension, slight faintness, palpitations, or a feeling of postural instability referred to by the patient as dizziness. Breathlessness, vague chest or upper abdominal discomfort, a palpitating sensation as if the heart were beating too hard, and a generalized “washed out” feeling (asthenia) are other common symptoms. More than 50 years ago Cohen and White listed the following symptoms in order of frequency in the patients they observed: palpitation, 97 percent; easy fatigue, 93 percent; breathlessness, 90 percent; nervousness, 88 percent; chest pain, 85 percent; sighing, 79 percent; dizziness, 78 percent; apprehensiveness, 61 percent; headache, 58 percent; paresthesias, 58 percent; weakness, 56 percent; insomnia, 53 percent; unhappiness, 50 percent. What is evident from this listing is that the experience of anxiety is a polysymptomatic physical syndrome. This was the basis of the James-Lang theory of emotion—that the physical-sensory experience was the central one and emotion followed. It is not surprising, therefore, that many patients with chronic or recurrent symptoms first consult a physician not with a complaint of “anxiety” but with symptoms referable to the cardiorespiratory system or gastrointestinal system (dyspepsia, loss of appetite, or “irritable colon”). Many patients experience a constant uneasiness that the spells may reoccur, especially in public; hence the patient may be fearful of leaving home lest help not be available should an attack occur (agoraphobia). Except in minor details, it is notable that the attacks are alike in any one individual. Between attacks, most patients feel relatively well but many complain of the symptoms of anxiety and asthenia in lesser but persistent fashion. Hyperventilation is a special, although not invariable, feature of the anxiety attack. Hyperventilation itself, by reducing the Pco2, will cause giddiness, paresthesias of the fingers, tongue, and lips, and, at times, frank tetany. However, contrary to what is stated in some textbooks, in only a minority of patients does a 3-min period of deep breathing reproduce the symptoms of an anxiety or panic attack.

","['Longo, Anthony S. Fauci The retroviruses, which make up a large family (Retroviridae), infect mainly vertebrates. These viruses have a unique replication cycle whereby their genetic information is encoded by RNA rather than DNA. Retroviruses contain an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase STRUCTURE AND LIFE CYCLE All retroviruses are similar in structure, genome organization, and mode of replication. Retroviruses are 70–130 nm in diameter and have a lipid-containing envelope surrounding an icosahedral capsid with a dense inner core. The core contains two identical copies of the single-strand RNA genome. The RNA molecules are 8–10 kb long and are complexed with reverse transcriptase and tRNA. Other viral proteins, such as integrase, are also components of the virion particle. The RNA has features usually found in mRNA: a cap site at the 5′ end of the mol-ecule, which is important in the initiation of mRNA translation, and 225e SECTion 14 infECTionS DuE To HumAn immunoDEfiCiEnCy ViRuS AnD oTHER HumAn RETRoViRuSES (a reverse transcriptase) that directs the synthesis of a DNA form of the viral genome after infection of a host cell. The designation retrovirus denotes that information in the form of RNA is transcribed into DNA in the host cell—a sequence that overturned a central dogma of molecular biology: that information passes unidirectionally from DNA to RNA to protein. The observation that RNA was the source of genetic information in the causative agents of certain animal tumors led to a number of paradigm-shifting biologic insights regarding not only the direction of genetic information passage but also the viral etiology of certain cancers and the concept of oncogenes as normal host genes scavenged and altered by a viral vector. The family Retroviridae includes seven subfamilies (Table 225e-1). Members of two of the families infect humans with pathologic consequences: the deltaretroviruses, of which human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type 1 is the most important in humans; and lentiviruses, of which HIV is the most important in humans. The wide variety of interactions of a retrovirus with its host range from completely benign events (e.g., silent carriage of endogenous retroviral sequences in the germline genome of many animal species) to rapidly fatal infections (e.g., exogenous infection with an oncogenic virus such as Rous sarcoma virus in chickens). The ability of retroviruses to acquire and alter the structure and function of host cell sequences has revolutionized our understanding of molecular carcinogenesis. The viruses can insert into the germline genome of the host cell and behave as a transposable or movable genetic element. They can activate or inactivate genes near the site of integration into the genome. They can rapidly alter their own genome by recombination and mutation under selective environmental stimuli. Most human viral diseases occur as a consequence of tissue destruction either directly by the virus itself or indirectly by the host’s response to the virus. Although these mechanisms are operative in retroviral infections, retroviruses have additional mechanisms of inducing disease, including the malignant transformation of an infected cell and the induction of an immunodeficiency state that renders the host susceptible to opportunistic diseases (infections and neoplasms; Chap. 226). a polyadenylation site at the 3′ end, which influences mRNA turnover (i.e., messages with shorter polyA tails turn over faster than messages with longer polyA tails). However, the retroviral RNA is not translated; instead it is transcribed into DNA. The DNA form of the retroviral genome is called a provirus. The replication cycle of retroviruses proceeds in two phases (Fig. 225e-1). In the first phase, the virus enters the cytoplasm after binding to one or more specific cell-surface receptors; the viral RNA and reverse transcriptase synthesize a double-strand DNA version of the RNA template; and the provirus moves into the nucleus and integrates into the host cell genome. This proviral integration is permanent. Although some animal retroviruses integrate into a single specific site of the host genome in every infected cell, the human retroviruses integrate randomly. This first phase of replication depends entirely on gene products in the virus. The second phase includes the synthesis and processing of viral genomes, mRNAs, and proteins using host cell machinery, often under the influence of viral gene products. Virions are assembled and released from the cell by budding from the membrane; host cell membrane proteins are frequently incorporated into the envelope of the virus. Proviral integration occurs during the S-phase of the cell cycle; thus, in general, nondividing cells are resistant to retroviral infection. Only the lentiviruses are able to infect nondividing cells. Once a host cell is infected, it is infected for the life of the cell. Retroviral genomes include both coding and noncoding sequences (Fig. 225e-2). In general, noncoding sequences are important recognition signals for DNA or RNA synthesis or processing events and are located in the 5′ and 3′ terminal regions of the genome. All retroviral genomes are terminally redundant, containing identical sequences called long terminal repeats (LTRs). The ends of the retroviral RNA genome differ slightly in sequence from the integrated retroviral DNA. In the latter, the LTR sequences are repeated in both the 5′ and the 3′ terminus of the virus. The LTRs contain sequences involved in initiating the expression of the viral proteins, the integration of the provirus, and the polyadenylation of viral RNAs. The primer binding site, which is critical for the initiation of reverse transcription, and the viral packaging sequences are located outside the LTR sequences. The coding regions include the gag (group-specific antigen, core protein), pol (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), and env (envelope) genes. The gag gene encodes a precursor polyprotein that is cleaved to form three to five capsid proteins; a fraction of the Gag precursor proteins also contain a protease responsible for cleaving the Gag and Pol polyproteins. A Gag-Pol polyprotein gives rise to the protease that is responsible for cleaving the Gag-Pol polyprotein. The pol gene encodes three proteins: the reverse transcriptase, the integrase, and the protease. The reverse transcriptase copies the viral RNA into the double-strand DNA provirus, which inserts itself into the host cell DNA via the action of integrase. The protease cleaves the Gag-Pol polyprotein into smaller protein products. The env gene encodes the envelope glycoproteins: one protein that binds to specific surface receptors and determines what cell types can be infected and a smaller transmembrane protein that anchors the complex to the envelope. Fig. 225e-3 shows how the retroviral gene products make up the virus structure. CHAPTER 225e The Human Retroviruses\n\n\n\nAdsorption to specific receptor\n\n\n\nFIgURE 225e-1 The life cycle of retroviruses. A. Overview of virus replication. The retrovirus enters a target cell by binding to a specific cell-surface receptor; once the virus is internalized, its RNA is released from the nucleocapsid and is reverse-transcribed into proviral DNA. The provirus is inserted into the genome and then transcribed into RNA; the RNA is translated; and virions assemble and are extruded from the cell membrane by budding. B. Overview of retroviral gene expression. The provirus is transcribed, capped, and polyadenylated. Viral RNA molecules then have one of three fates: they are exported to the cytoplasm, where they are packaged as the viral RNA in infectious viral particles; they are spliced to form the message for the envelope polyprotein; or they are translated into Gag and Pol proteins. Most of the messages for the Pol protein fail to initiate Pol translation because of a stop codon before its initiation; however, in a fraction of the messages, the stop codon is missed and the Pol proteins are translated. (Modified from JM Coffin, in BN Fields, DM Knipe [eds]: Fields Virology. New York, Raven, 1990; with permission.)\n\n\n\nHTLVs have a region between env and the 3′ LTR that encodes several proteins and transcripts in overlapping reading frames (Fig. 225e-2). Tax is a 40-kDa protein that does not bind to DNA but induces the expression of host cell transcription factors that alter host cell gene expression and is capable of inducing cell transformation under certain circumstances. Rex is a 27-kDa protein that regulates the expression of viral mRNAs. Other transcripts from this region (p12, p13, p30) tend to restrict expression of viral genes and diminish the immunogenicity of infected cells. The protein of HBZ, a product of the complementary proviral DNA strand, interacts with many cellular transcription factors and signaling proteins. It stimulates proliferation of infected cells and is the only viral product universally expressed in HTLV-1-infected tumor cells. These proteins are produced from messages that are similar but that are spliced differently from overlapping but distinct exons. The lentiviruses in general, and HIV-1 and -2 in particular, contain a larger genome than other pathogenic retroviruses. They contain an untranslated region between pol and env that encodes portions of several proteins, varying with the reading frame into which the mRNA is spliced. Tat is a 14-kDa protein that augments the expression of virus from the LTR. The Rev protein of HIV-1, similar to the Rex protein of HTLV, regulates RNA splicing and/or RNA transport. The Nef protein downregulates CD4, the cellular receptor for HIV; alters host T cell–activation pathways; and enhances viral infectivity. The Vif protein is necessary for the proper assembly of the HIV nucleoprotein core in many types of cells; without Vif, proviral DNA is not efficiently produced in these infected cells. In addition, the Vif protein targets APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide, a cytidine deaminase that mutates the viral sequence) for proteasomal degradation, thus blocking its virus-suppressing effect. Vpr, Vpu (HIV-1 only), and Vpx (HIV-2 only) are viral proteins encoded by translation of the same message in different reading frames. As noted above, oncogenic retroviruses depend on cell proliferation for their replication; lentiviruses can infect nondividing cells, largely through effects mediated by Vpr. Vpr facilitates transport of the provirus into the nucleus and can induce other cellular changes, such as G2 growth arrest and differentiation of some target cells. Vpx is structurally related to Vpr, but its functions are not fully defined. Vpu promotes the degradation of CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum and stimulates the release of virions from infected cells. Retroviruses can be either exogenously acquired (by infection with an infected cell or a free virion capable of replication) or transmitted in the germline as endogenous virus. Endogenous retroviruses are often replication defective. The human genome contains endogenous retroviral sequences, but there are no known replication-competent endogenous retroviruses in humans. In general, viruses that contain only the gag, pol, and env genes either are not pathogenic or take a long time to induce disease; these observations indicate the importance of the other regulatory genes in viral disease pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of neoplastic transformation by retroviruses relies on the chance integration of the provirus at a spot in the genome resulting in the expression of a cellular gene (protooncogene) that becomes transforming by virtue of its unregulated expression. For example, avian leukosis virus causes B cell leukemia by inducing the expression of myc. Some retroviruses possess captured and altered cellular genes near their integration site, and these viral oncogenes can transform the infected host cell. Viruses that have oncogenes often have lost a portion of their genome that is required for replication. Such viruses need helper viruses to reproduce, a feature that may explain why these acute transforming retroviruses are rare in nature. All human retroviruses identified to date are exogenous and are not acutely transforming (i.e., they lack a transforming oncogene). These remarkable properties of retroviruses have led to experimental efforts to use them as vectors to insert specific genes into particular cell types, a process known as gene therapy or gene transfer. The process could be used to repair a genetic defect or to introduce a new property that could be used therapeutically; for example, a gene (e.g., thymidine kinase) that would make a tumor cell susceptible to killing by a drug (e.g., ganciclovir) could be inserted. One source of concern about the use of retroviral vectors in humans is that replication-competent viruses might rescue endogenous retroviral replication, with unpredictable results. This concern is not merely hypothetical: the detection of proteins encoded by endogenous retroviral sequences on the surface of cancer cells implies that the genetic events leading to the cancer were able to activate the synthesis of these usually silent genes. HTLV-1 was isolated in 1980 from a T cell lymphoma cell line from a patient originally thought to have cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Later it became clear that the patient had a distinct form of lymphoma (originally reported in Japan) called adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Serologic data have determined that HTLV-1 is the cause of at least two important diseases: ATL and tropical spastic paraparesis, also\n\n\n\nLTR GAG POL LTR LTR MA CA NC PR RT GP46 p21HTLV-I,II\n\n\n\nTAX, p40 REX, p27 p30\n\n\n\nTAT, p14 PR POL\n\n\n\nREV, p19\n\n\n\nFIgURE 225e-2 Genomic structure of retroviruses. The murine leukemia virus MuLV has the typical three structural genes: gag, pol, and env. The gag region gives rise to three proteins: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleic acid–binding (NC) proteins. The pol region encodes both a protease (PR) responsible for cleaving the viral polyproteins and a reverse transcriptase (RT ). In addition, HIV pol encodes an integrase (IN). The env region encodes a surface protein (SU) and a small transmembrane protein ( TM). The human retroviruses have additional gene products translated in each of the three possible reading frames. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 have tax and rex genes with exons on either side of the env gene. HIV-1 and HIV-2 have six accessory gene products: tat, rev, vif, nef, vpr, and either vpu (in HIV-1) or vpx (in HIV-2). The genes for these proteins are located mainly between the pol and env genes.', '46, 651–675. Varmus H (1988) Retroviruses. Science 240, 1427–1435. How Cells Read the Genome: From DNA to Protein\n\n\n\nSince the structure of DNA was discovered in the early 1950s, progress in cell and molecular biology has been astounding. We now know the complete genome sequences for thousands of different organisms, revealing fascinating details of their biochemistry as well as important clues as to how these organisms evolved. Complete genome sequences have also been obtained for thousands of individual humans, as well as for a few of our now-extinct relatives, such as the Neanderthals. Knowing the maximum amount of information that is required to produce a complex organism like ourselves puts constraints on the biochemical and structural features of cells and makes it clear that biology is not infinitely complex. As discussed in Chapter 1, the DNA in genomes does not direct protein synthesis itself, but instead uses RNA as an intermediary. When the cell needs a particular protein, the nucleotide sequence of the appropriate portion of the immensely long DNA molecule in a chromosome is first copied into RNA (a process called transcription). It is these RNA copies of segments of the DNA that are used directly as templates to direct the synthesis of the protein (a process called translation). The flow of genetic information in cells is therefore from DNA to RNA to protein (Figure 6–1). All cells, from bacteria to humans, express their genetic information in this way—a principle so fundamental that it is termed the central dogma of molecular biology. Despite the universality of the central dogma of molecular biology, there are important variations between organisms in the way in which information flows from DNA to protein. Principal among these is that RNA transcripts in eukaryotic cells are subject to a series of processing steps in the nucleus, including RNA splicing, before they are permitted to exit from the nucleus and be translated into protein. As we discuss in this chapter, these processing steps can critically change the “meaning” of an RNA molecule and are therefore crucial for understanding how eukaryotic cells read their genome. Although we focus on the production of the proteins encoded by the genome in this chapter, we see that for many genes, RNA is the final product. Like proteins, some of these RNAs fold into precise three-dimensional structures that have structural and catalytic roles in the cell. Other RNAs, as we discuss in the next chapter, act primarily as regulators of gene expression. But the roles of many non-coding RNAs are not yet known. One might have predicted that the information present in genomes would be arranged in an orderly fashion, resembling a dictionary or a telephone directory. But it turns out that the genomes of most multicellular organisms are surprisingly disorderly, reflecting their chaotic evolutionary histories. The genes in these organisms largely consist of a long string of alternating short exons and long introns, as discussed in Chapter 4 (see Figure 4–15D). Moreover, small bits of DNA sequence that code for protein are interspersed with large blocks of seemingly meaningless DNA. Some sections of the genome contain many genes and others lack genes altogether. Proteins that work closely with one another in the cell often have their genes located on different chromosomes, and adjacent genes typically encode proteins that have little to do with each other in the cell. Decoding genomes is therefore no simple matter. Even with the aid of powerful computers, it is difficult for researchers to locate definitively the beginning and end of genes, much less to decipher when and where each gene is expressed in the life of the\n\n\n\nFigure 6–1 The pathway from DNA to protein.

As summarized in the key, the known protein-coding genes (starting with Abcd1 and ending with F8) are shown in dark gray, with coding regions (exons) indicated by bars that extend above and below the central line. Noncoding RNAs with known functions are indicated by purple diamonds. Yellow triangles indicate positions within protein-coding regions where the Neanderthal genome sequences codes for a different amino acid than the human genome. The stretch of yellow triangles in the Txtl1 gene appear to have been positively selected for since the divergence of Homo sapiens from Neanderthals some 200,000 years ago. Note that most of the proteins are identical between us and our extinct relative. The blue histogram indicates the extent to which portions of the human genome are conserved with other vertebrate species. It is likely that additional genes, currently unrecognized, also lie within this portion of the human genome. Genes whose mutation causes an inherited human condition are indicated by red brackets. The Abcd1 gene codes for a protein that imports fatty acids into the peroxisome; mutations in the gene cause demylination of nerves which can result in cognition and movement disorders. Incontinentia pigmenti is a disease of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and eyes. Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the Factor VIII gene, which codes for a blood-clotting protein. Because males have only a single copy of the X chromosome, most of the conditions shown here affect only males; females that inherit one of these defective genes are often asymptomatic because a functional protein is made from their other X chromosome.

For RNA viruses with a single-stranded genome, the replication strategy depends on whether the RNA is a positive [+] strand, which contains translatable information like mRNA, or a complementary negative [–] strand. When the RNA is a positive [+] strand, the incoming viral genome is used to produce the viral RNA polymerase and viral proteins; the viral polymerase is then used to replicate the viral RNA and to generate mRNAs for the production of more viral proteins. For viruses with a negative [–] strand RNA genome (such as influenza and measles virus), an RNA polymerase enzyme is packaged as a structural protein of the incoming viral capsids.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0

","['In patients whose arterial O2 saturation is normal, supplemental O2 is of limited if any clinical benefit and therefore is not cost-effective. However, when hypoxemia is present, O2 should be administered by nasal prongs or face mask (2–4 L/min) for the first 6–12 h after infarction; the patient should then be reassessed to determine if there is a continued need for such treatment. Sublingual nitroglycerin can be given safely to most patients with STEMI. Up to three doses of 0.4 mg should be administered at about 5-min intervals. In addition to diminishing or abolishing chest discomfort, nitroglycerin may be capable of both decreasing myocardial oxygen demand (by lowering preload) and increasing myocardial oxygen supply (by dilating infarct-related coronary vessels or collateral vessels). In patients whose initially favorable response to sublingual nitroglycerin is followed by the return of chest discomfort, particularly if accompanied by other evidence of ongoing ischemia such as further ST-segment or T-wave shifts, the use of intravenous nitroglycerin should be considered. Therapy with nitrates should be avoided in patients who present with low systolic arterial pressure (<90 mmHg) or in whom there is clinical suspicion of RV infarction (inferior infarction on ECG, elevated jugular venous pressure, clear lungs, and hypo-tension). Nitrates should not be administered to patients who have taken a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction within the preceding 24 h, because it may potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates. An idiosyncratic reaction to nitrates, consisting of sudden marked hypotension, sometimes occurs but can usually be reversed promptly by the rapid administration of intravenous atropine. Morphine is a very effective analgesic for the pain associated with STEMI. However, it may reduce sympathetically mediated arteriolar and venous constriction, and the resulting venous pooling may reduce cardiac output and arterial pressure. These hemodynamic disturbances usually respond promptly to elevation of the legs, but in some patients, volume expansion with intravenous saline is required. The patient may experience diaphoresis and nausea, but these events usually pass and are replaced by a feeling of well-being associated with the relief of pain. Morphine also has a vagotonic effect and may cause bradycardia or advanced degrees of heart block, particularly in patients with inferior infarction. These side effects usually respond to atropine (0.5 mg intravenously). Morphine is routinely administered by repetitive (every 5 min) intravenous injection of small doses (2–4 mg), rather than by the subcutaneous administration of a larger quantity, because absorption may be unpredictable by the latter route. Intravenous beta blockers are also useful in the control of the pain of STEMI. These drugs control pain effectively in some patients, presumably by diminishing myocardial O2 demand and hence ischemia. More important, there is evidence that intravenous beta blockers reduce the risks of reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation (see “Beta-Adrenoceptor Blockers” below). However, patient selection is important when considering beta blockers for STEMI. Oral beta blocker therapy should be initiated in the first 24 h for patients who do not have any of the following: (1) signs of heart failure, (2) evidence of a low-output state, (3) increased risk for cardiogenic shock, or (4) other\n\n\n\nSTEMI patient who is a candidate for reperfusion Diagnostic angiogram Medical therapy only PCI CABG Initially seen at a PCI-capable hospital Initially seen at a non-PCI-capable hospital* Send to cath lab for primary PCI FMC-device time ˜90 min (Class I, LOE: A) Transfer for angiography and revascularization within 3–24 h for other patients as part of an invasive strategy† (Class IIa, LOE: B) Transfer for primary PCI FMC-device time as soon as possible and ˜120 min (Class I, LOE: B) Administer fibrinolytic agent within 30 min of arrival when anticipated FMC-device >120 min (Class I, LOE: B) Urgent transfer for PCI for patients with evidence of failed reperfusion or reocclusion (Class IIa, LOE: B) DIDO time ˜30 min\n\n\n\nFIGURE 295-4 Reperfusion therapy for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

A commonly employed regimen is metoprolol, 5 mg every 2–5 min for a total of three doses, provided the patient has a heart rate >60 beats/min, systolic pressure >100 mmHg, a PR interval <0.24 s, and rales that are no higher than 10 cm up from the diaphragm. Fifteen minutes after the last intravenous dose, an oral regimen is initiated of 50 mg every 6 h for 48 h, followed by 100 mg every 12 h. Unlike beta blockers, calcium antagonists are of little value in the acute setting, and there is evidence that short-acting dihydropyridines may be associated with an increased mortality risk. The primary tool for screening patients and making triage decisions is the initial 12-lead ECG. When ST-segment elevation of at least 2 mm in two contiguous precordial leads and 1 mm in two adjacent limb leads is present, a patient should be considered a candidate for reperfusion therapy (Fig. 295-4). The process of selecting patients for fibrinolysis versus primary PCI (angioplasty or stenting; Chap. 296e) is discussed below. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, fibrinolysis is not helpful, and evidence exists suggesting that it may be harmful. The quantity of myocardium that becomes necrotic as a consequence of a coronary artery occlusion is determined by factors other than just the site of occlusion. While the central zone of the infarct contains necrotic tissue that is irretrievably lost, the fate of the surrounding ischemic myocardium (ischemic penumbra) may be improved by timely restoration of coronary perfusion, reduction of myocardial O2 demands, prevention of the accumulation of noxious metabolites, and blunting of the impact of mediators of reperfusion injury (e.g., calcium overload and oxygen-derived free radicals). Up to one-third of patients with STEMI may achieve spontaneous reperfusion of the infarct-related coronary artery within 24 h and experience improved healing of infarcted tissue. Reperfusion, either pharmacologically (by fibrinolysis) or by PCI, accelerates the opening of infarct-related arteries in those patients in whom spontaneous fibrinolysis ultimately would have occurred and also greatly increases the number of patients in whom restoration of flow in the infarct-related artery is accomplished. Timely restoration of flow in the epicardial infarct–related artery combined with improved perfusion of the downstream zone of infarcted myocardium results in a limitation of infarct size. Protection of the ischemic myocardium by the maintenance of an optimal balance between myocardial O2 supply and demand through pain control, treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), and minimization of tachycardia and hypertension extends the “window” of time for the salvage of myocardium by reperfusion strategies. Glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, with the exception of aspirin, should be avoided in patients with STEMI. They can impair infarct healing and increase the risk of myocardial rupture, and their use may result in a larger infarct scar.', 'Topical or oral nitrates (Chap. 293) can be used when the pain has resolved, or they may replace intravenous nitroglycerin when the patient has been pain-free for 12–24 h. The only absolute contraindications to the use of nitrates are hypotension or the use of sildenafil or other phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors within the previous 24–48 h. Beta Adrenergic Blockers and Other Agents Beta blockers are the other mainstay of anti-ischemic treatment. They may be started by the intravenous route in patients with severe ischemia, but this is contraindicated in the presence of heart failure. Ordinarily, oral beta blockade targeted to a heart rate of 50–60 beats/min is recommended. Heart rate–slowing calcium channel blockers, e.g., verapamil or diltiazem, are recommended for patients who have persistent symptoms or ECG signs of ischemia after treatment with full-dose nitrates and beta blockers and in patients with contraindications to either class of these agents. Additional medical therapy includes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or, if these are not tolerated, angiotensin receptor blockers. Early administration of intensive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), such as atorvastatin 80 mg/d, prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and continued thereafter, has been shown to reduce complications of the procedure and recurrences of ACS. with increases in the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. Alternate P2Y12 blockers, such as prasugrel or ticagrelor (see below) used with aspirin, should be considered in patients with NSTE-ACS who develop a coronary event while receiving clopidogrel and aspirin or who are hyporesponsive to clopidogrel as identified by platelet and/or genetic testing, although such testing is not yet widespread. A second P2Y12 blocker, prasugrel, also a thienopyridine, achieves a more rapid onset and higher level of platelet inhibition than clopidogrel. It has been approved for ACS patients following angiography in whom PCI is planned. It should be administered at a loading dose of 60 mg followed by 10 mg/d for up to 15 months. The TRITON-TIMI 38 trial showed that relative to clopidogrel, prasugrel reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke significantly, albeit with an increase in major bleeding. Stent thrombosis was reduced by half. This agent is contraindicated in patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or at high risk for bleeding.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['To provide relief and prevention of recurrence of chest pain, initial treatment should include bed rest, nitrates, beta adrenergic blockers, and inhaled oxygen in the presence of hypoxemia.\n\n\n\nNitrates These should first be given sublingually or by buccal spray (0.3–0.6 mg) if the patient is experiencing ischemic pain.

Efforts should be made to define the primary site based on age, sex, sites of involvement, histology and tumor markers, and personal and family history. Particular attention should be focused on ruling out the most treatable causes (Chap. 120e). Once the diagnosis of cancer is made, the management of the patient is best undertaken as a multidisciplinary collaboration among the primary care physician, medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, oncology nurse specialists, pharmacists, social workers, rehabilitation medicine specialists, and a number of other consulting professionals working closely with each other and with the patient and family.

Avoidance of triggers of acute attacks; symptomatic treatment during acute episodes. High doses of glucose may be administered to ↓ heme synthesis during mild attacks, and IV hematin can be given for severe attacks (provides feedback to the heme synthetic pathway). Heme is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome molecules. The telltale sign of porphyria is pink urine. The classic case of porphyria involves a college student who consumes alcohol and barbiturates at a party, and then has an acute episode of abdominal pain and brown urine the next day. Malignant proliferations of hematopoietic cells, categorized by the type of cell involved and their level of differentiation. Leukemias may be acute or chronic, lymphocytic or myelogenous. The four oncologic emergencies: hypercalcemia, spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, and leukostasis. Acute myelogenous and lymphocytic leukemias are clonal disorders of early hematopoietic stem cells. They are characterized by rapid growth of immature blood cells (blasts), which overwhelms the ability of bone marrow to produce normal cells. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) affect children as well as adults. ALL is the most common childhood malignancy. Disease onset and progression are rapid; patients present with signs and symptoms of anemia (pallor, fatigue) and thrombocytopenia (petechiae, purpura, bleeding). Medullary expansion and periosteal involvement may lead to bone pain (common in ALL). On exam, patients may have hepatosplenomegaly and swollen/bleeding gums from leukemic infiltration and ↓ platelets. Leukemic cells also infiltrate the skin and CNS. Based on examination of the patient’s bone marrow, obtained by biopsy and aspiration, or peripheral blood if circulating blasts are present. Marrow that is infiltrated with blast cells (> 20–30%) is consistent with a leukemic process. In AML, the leukemic cells are myeloblasts; in ALL they are lymphoblasts. These cells may be distinguished by examination of morphology, cytogenetics, cytochemistry, and immunophenotyping (see Table 2.7-6). The WBC count is usually elevated, but the cells are dysfunctional, and patients may be neutropenic with a history of frequent infection. If the WBC is very high (> 100,000), there is a risk of leukostasis (blasts occluding the microcirculation, leading to pulmonary edema, CNS symptoms, ischemic injury, and DIC). The type of acute leukemia is further classified according to the FAB system (ALL: L1–L3; AML: M0–M7) and karyotype analysis. Prognosis varies with leukemic cytogenetics. T AB LE 2.7 -6.

Patients with unfavorable genetics or those who do not achieve remission may be candidates for bone marrow transplantation. Prior to therapy, patients should be well hydrated, and if their WBC counts are high, they may be started on allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia and renal insufficiency resulting from blast lysis (tumor lysis syndrome). Leukostasis syndrome may be treated with hydroxyurea +/– leukapheresis to rapidly ↓ WBC count. Indicators of a poor prognosis are as follows:\n\n\n\nALL: Age < 1 year or > 10 years; an ↑ in WBC count to > 50,000; the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9,22) (associated with B-cell cancer); CNS involvement at diagnosis; and L3 morphology (associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma). AML: Age > 60 years, CD34+ or MDR1+ phenotype, elevated LDH, mutations in chromosomes 5 or 7, t(6,9), trisomy 8 or a more complex karyotype, FLT3 gene mutation, and FAB M7 (acute megakaryocytic variant). AML type (FAB) M3—acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)—has a good prognosis because it is responsive to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. The mutation that causes this form of AML contains the retinoic acid receptor. ATRA is less toxic than conventional chemotherapy. A malignant, clonal proliferation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes that accumulate in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. The most common type of leukemia. A rare form of T-cell CLL exists, but almost all cases involve well-differentiated B lymphocytes. The etiology is unknown, although there is some genetic contribution, as first-degree relatives of patients with CLL are three times more likely than others to develop a lymphoid malignancy. Primarily affects older adults (median age 65); the male-to-female ratio is 2:1. Often asymptomatic, but many patients present with fatigue, malaise, and infection. Common physical findings are lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Diagnosed by the clinical picture; may be confirmed by f ow cytometry demonstrating the presence of CD5—normally found only on T cells—on leukemic cells with the characteristic B-cell antigens CD20 and CD21. CBC shows lymphocytosis (lymphocyte count > 5000) with an abundance of small, normal-appearing lymphocytes and ruptured smudge cells on peripheral smear. Granulocytopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are common owing to marrow infiltration with leukemic cells. Abnormal function by the leukemic cells leads to hypogammaglobulinemia. Bone marrow biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis or staging but may provide prognostic information and may help assess response to therapy. A characteristic sign for AML type M3 (APL) is the\n\n\n\nAuer rod. Eighty-five percent of children with ALL achieve complete remission with chemotherapy. CLL may be complicated by autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The lymphoid equivalent of CLL is small lymphocytic lymphoma. The clinical stage correlates with expected survival (see Table 2.7-7). Treatment is palliative. The degree of peripheral lymphocytosis does not correlate with prognosis, nor does it dictate when treatment should be initiated. Treatment is often withheld until patients are symptomatic—e.g., when they present with recurrent infection, severe lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Treatment consists primarily of chemotherapy, especially with alkylating agents, although radiation may be useful for localized lymphadenopathy. Although CLL is not curable, long disease-free intervals may be achieved with adequate treatment of symptoms. Involves clonal expansion of myeloid progenitor cells, leading to leukocytosis with excess granulocytes and basophils and sometimes ↑ erythrocytes and platelets as well.

","['Hirsutism David A. Ehrmann Hirsutism, which is defined as androgen-dependent excessive male-pattern hair growth, affects approximately 10% of women. Hirsutism is most often idiopathic or the consequence of androgen excess associ-ated with the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Less frequently, it 68 may result from adrenal androgen overproduction as occurs in non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) (Table 68-1). Rarely, it is a sign of a serious underlying condition. Cutaneous manifestations commonly associated with hirsutism include acne and male-pattern balding (androgenic alopecia). Virilization refers to a condition in which androgen levels are sufficiently high to cause additional signs and symptoms, such as deepening of the voice, breast atrophy,\n\n\n\nSyndromes of extreme insulin resistance (e.g., lipodystrophy)\n\n\n\nThecoma of pregnancy increased muscle bulk, clitoromegaly, and increased libido; virilization is an ominous sign that suggests the possibility of an ovarian or adrenal neoplasm. Hair can be categorized as either vellus (fine, soft, and not pigmented) or terminal (long, coarse, and pigmented). The number of hair follicles does not change over an individual’s lifetime, but the follicle size and type of hair can change in response to numerous factors, particularly androgens. Androgens are necessary for terminal hair and sebaceous gland development and mediate differentiation of pilosebaceous units (PSUs) into either a terminal hair follicle or a sebaceous gland. In the former case, androgens transform the vellus hair into a terminal hair; in the latter case, the sebaceous component proliferates and the hair remains vellus. There are three phases in the cycle of hair growth: (1) anagen (growth phase), (2) catagen (involution phase), and (3) telogen (rest phase). Depending on the body site, hormonal regulation may play an important role in the hair growth cycle. For example, the eyebrows, eyelashes, and vellus hairs are androgen-insensitive, whereas the axillary and pubic areas are sensitive to low levels of androgens. Hair growth on the face, chest, upper abdomen, and back requires higher levels of androgens and is therefore more characteristic of the pattern typically seen in men. Androgen excess in women leads to increased hair growth in most androgen-sensitive sites except in the scalp region, where hair loss occurs because androgens cause scalp hairs to spend less time in the anagen phase. Although androgen excess underlies most cases of hirsutism, there is only a modest correlation between androgen levels and the quantity of hair growth. This is due to the fact that hair growth from the follicle also 332 depends on local growth factors, and there is variability in end organ (PSU) sensitivity. Genetic factors and ethnic background also influence hair growth. In general, dark-haired individuals tend to be more hirsute than blond or fair individuals. Asians and Native Americans have relatively sparse hair in regions sensitive to high androgen levels, whereas people of Mediterranean descent are more hirsute. Historic elements relevant to the assessment of hirsutism include the age at onset and rate of progression of hair growth and associated symptoms or signs (e.g., acne). Depending on the cause, excess hair growth typically is first noted during the second and third decades of life. The growth is usually slow but progressive. Sudden development and rapid progression of hirsutism suggest the possibility of an androgen-secreting neoplasm, in which case virilization also may be present. The age at onset of menstrual cycles (menarche) and the pattern of the menstrual cycle should be ascertained; irregular cycles from the time of menarche onward are more likely to result from ovarian rather than adrenal androgen excess. Associated symptoms such as galactorrhea should prompt evaluation for hyperprolactinemia (Chap. 403) and possibly hypothyroidism (Chap.', '3.

Cardiac malformations are the most common class of congenital anomalies, and their overall prevalence is 8 in 1000 births (Cragan, 2009). Almost 90 percent of cardiac defects are multifactorial or polygenic in origin, another 1 to 2 percent result from a single-gene disorder or gene-deletion syndrome, and 1 to 2 percent stem from exposure to a teratogen such as isotretinoin, hydantoin, or maternal diabetes. Based on data from population-based registries, approximately 1 in 8 liveborn and stillborn neonates with a congenital heart defect has a chromosomal abnormality (Dolk, 2010; Hartman, 201l). Of chromosomal abnormalities associated with cardiac anomalies, trisomy 21 accounts for more than 50 percent of cases. Others are trisomy 18, 22q 11.2 deletion, trisomy 13, and monosomy X (Hartman, 2011). Of these aneuploid fetuses, 50 to 70 percent also have extracardiac anomalies. Chromo defects are found. Traditionally, detection of congenital cardiac anomalies is more challenging than for anomalies of other organ systems. 40 percent of those with major cardiac anomalies before 22 weeks\' gestation, and specialized sonography may identiy 80 percent (Romosan, 2009; Trivedi, 2012). For selected anoma lies, prenatal detection may improve neonatal survival. his requiring prostaglandin infusion after birth to keep the duc tus arteriosus open (Franklin, 2002; Mahle, 2001; Tworetzky, 2001). Standard cardiac assessment includes a four-chamber view, evaluation of rate and rhythm, and evaluation of the left and right ventricular outlow tracts (Figs. 10-27 and 10-28A-C). Examination of the cardiac outflow tracts aids detection of abnormalities that might not be appreciated in the four-cham ber view. hese include tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great vessels, and truncus arteriosus. heour-chamber view is a transverse image of the fetal tho rax at a level immediately above the diaphragm. It allows evalu ation of cardiac size, position in the thorax, cardiac axis, atria and ventricles, foramen ovale, atrial septum primum, interven tricular septum, and atrioventricular valves (see Fig. 10-27). he atria and ventricles should be similar in size, and the apex of the heart should form a 45-degree angle with the left anterior chest wall. Abnormalities of cardiac axis are frequently encoun tered with structural cardiac anomalies and occur in more than a third (Shipp, 1995). The lt ventricular oulow tract view is a transverse image just above the diaphragm and demonstrates that the ascending aorta arises entirely from the left ventricle. The inteventricular septum is shown to be in continuity with the anterior wall of the aorta, and the mitral valve in continuity with the posterior wall of the aorta (see Fig. 10-28B). Ventricular septal defects and outflow tract abnormalities are often visible in this view (Fig. 10-29). The right ventricular oulow tract view shows the right ventricle giving rise to the pulmonary artery (see Fig. 10-28C). Together, the left and right outflow tract views demonstrate the normal perpendicular orientation of the aorta and pulmonary artery, and the comparable size of these great arteries.

Intrauterine risk factors for congenital heart disease include maternal drug use (alcohol, lithium, thalidomide, phenytoin), maternal infections (rubella), and maternal illness (DM, PKU).

Acyanotic conditions (“pink babies”): Have left-to-right shunts in which oxygenated blood from the lungs is shunted back into the pulmonary circulation. Cyanotic conditions (“blue babies”): Have right-to-left shunts in which deoxygenated blood is shunted into the systemic circulation. A condition in which an opening in the ventricular septum allows blood to ﬂow between ventricles. VSD is the most common congenital heart defect. It is more common among patients with Apert’s syndrome (cranial deformities, fusion of the fingers and toes), Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, TORCH syndrome (toxoplasmosis, other agents, rubella, CMV, HSV), cri du chat syndrome, and trisomies 13 and 18. Small defects are usually asymptomatic at birth, but exam reveals a harsh holosystolic murmur heard best at the lower left sternal border. Large defects can present with frequent respiratory infections, dyspnea, FTT, and CHF. If present, the holosystolic murmur is softer and more blowing but can be accompanied by a systolic thrill, crackles, a narrow S2 with an ↑ P1, and a mid-diastolic apical rumble reﬂ ecting ↑ ﬂow across the mitral valve. Echocardiogram is diagnostic. ECG and CXR can demonstrate LVH with small defects and show both LVH and RVH with larger VSDs. CXR may show ↑ pulmonary vascular markings. Most small VSDs close spontaneously; patients should be monitored via echocardiography. Surgical repair is indicated in symptomatic patients who fail medical management, children < 1 year of age with signs of pulmonary hypertension, and older children with large VSDs that have not ↓ in size over time. Treat existing CHF with diuretics, inotropes, and ACEIs; treat respiratory infections as needed. A condition in which an opening in the atrial septum allows blood to ﬂ ow between the atria, leading to left-to-right shunting. Associated with Holt-Oram syndrome (absent radii, ASD, first-degree heart block), fetal alcohol syndrome, and Down syndrome. Ostium primum defects present in early childhood with findings of a murmur or fatigue with exertion. Ostium secundum defects (most common) tend to present in late childhood or early adulthood. Symptom onset and severity depend on the size of the defect. Symptoms of easy fatigability, frequent respiratory infections, and FTT can be observed, but patients are frequently asymptomatic. ASD has a f xed, widely split S2. ■Exam reveals a right ventricular heave; a wide and fxed, split S2; and a systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border (from ↑ ﬂ ow across the pulmonary valve). There may also be a mid-diastolic rumble at the left lower sternal border. Echocardiogram with color ﬂow Doppler reveals blood ﬂow between the atria (diagnostic), paradoxical ventricular wall motion, and a dilated right ventricle. ECG most commonly shows right axis deviation and RVH, although other patterns are possible depending on the type of defect. PR prolongation is common. CXR reveals cardiomegaly and ↑ pulmonary vascular markings. Most lesions are small defects that may close spontaneously and do not require treatment. Surgical closure is indicated in infants with CHF and in patients with more than a 2:1 ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood ﬂow. Early correction prevents complications such as arrhythmias, right ventricular dysfunction, and Eisenmenger’s syndrome. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close in the first few days of life, leading to a left-to-right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Risk factors include maternal first-trimester rubella infection, prematurity, and female gender. Typically asymptomatic; patients with large defects may present with FTT, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, lower extremity clubbing, and CHF. Exam reveals a wide pulse pressure; a continuous “machinery murmur” at the second left intercostal space at the sternal border; a loud S2; and bounding peripheral pulses. A color ﬂow Doppler demonstrating blood ﬂow from the aorta into the pulmonary artery is diagnostic. With larger PDAs, echocardiography shows left atrial and left ventricular enlargement. ECG may show LVH, and CXR may show cardiomegaly if large lesions. Give indomethacin unless the PDA is needed for survival (e.g., transposition of the great vessels, tetralogy of Fallot, hypoplastic left heart) or if indomethacin is contraindicated (e.g., intraventricular hemorrhage). If indomethacin fails or if the child is > 6–8 months of age, surgical closure is required. In Eisenmenger’s syndrome, left-to-right shunt leads to pulmonary hypertension and shunt reversal.

","['Cardiovascular Effects\n\n\n\nPostural hypotension may occur, particularly at the initiation of therapy. Painless digital vasospasm is a dose-related complication of long-term treatment with the ergot derivatives (bromocriptine or pergolide). When cardiac arrhythmias occur, they are an indication for discontinuing treatment. Peripheral edema is sometimes problematic. Cardiac valvulopathy may occur with pergolide. C. Dyskinesias\n\n\n\nAbnormal movements similar to those introduced by levodopa may occur and are reversed by reducing the total dose of dopaminergic drugs being taken. D. Mental Disturbances\n\n\n\nConfusion, hallucinations, delusions, and other psychiatric reactions may develop as a feature of Parkinson’s disease or as complications of dopaminergic treatment and are more common and severe with dopamine receptor agonists than with levodopa. They tend to occur earlier in older patients and become more common as the disease advances. There appears to be no difference between the various dopamine agonists in their ability to induce these disorders. They may respond to atypical anti-psychotic agents such as clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone or to pimavanserin. Disorders of impulse control may occur either as an exaggeration of a previous tendency or as a new phenomenon and may lead to compulsive gambling, shopping, betting, sexual activity, and other behaviors (see Chapter 32). Their prevalence varies in different reports but may be as high as 15–25% in parkinsonian patients treated with dopamine agonists. They relate to activation of D2 or D3 dopamine receptors in the mesocorticolimbic system, may occur with one dopamine agonist and not another, and may occur at any time after the initiation of treatment.', 'A return of libido may lead to sexual assertiveness. Other curious effects of excessive drive from l-dopa and dopamine agonists have been pathologic gambling as mentioned earlier (the same has been seen in treatment of restless legs syndrome) and odd behaviors such as cross-dressing (Quinn et al, 1983). Anticholinergic agents or l-dopa should not generally be discontinued abruptly in advanced Parkinson disease. If abruptly discontinued, the patient may become totally immobilized by a sudden and severe increase of tremor and rigidity; rarely, a neuroleptic syndrome, sometimes fatal, has been induced by such withdrawal. Reducing the medication dose over a week or so is usually adequate. With progressive loss of nigral cells, there is an increasing inability to store l-dopa and periods of drug effectiveness become shorter. In some instances, the patient becomes so sensitive to l-dopa that 50 to 100 mg will precipitate dyskinesias; if the dose is lowered by the same amount, the patient may develop disabling rigidity. With the end-of-dose loss of effectiveness and the on–off phenomenon, which with time become increasingly frequent and unpredictable, the patient may experience pain, respiratory distress, akathisia, depression, anxiety, and even hallucinations. Some patients function quite well in the morning and much less well in the afternoon, or vice versa. In such cases, and for end-of-dose and on–off phenomena, one may titrate the dose of l-dopa and use more frequent dosing during the 24-h day; combining it with a dopamine agonist or a long-acting preparation may be helpful. Sometimes temporarily withdrawing l-dopa and at the same time substituting other medications may reduce the on–off phenomenon. Based on the principle that alimentary-derived amino acids compete for absorption of l-dopa, the use of a low-protein diet has been advocated as a means of controlling the motor fluctuations (Pincus and Barry). Symptoms can sometimes be reduced by the simple expedient of eliminating dietary protein from breakfast and lunch. Moreover, this dietary regimen may permit the patient to reduce slightly the total daily dose of l-dopa. Such dietary manipulation is worth trying in appropriate patients; it is not harmful, and most of our patients with advanced disease who have persisted with this diet have reported improvement in their symptoms or an enhanced effect of l-dopa. A novel observation by Pierantozzi and colleagues has been that the absorption of l-dopa may be influenced by the presence of gastric Helicobacter pylori infection and that eradication of the organism was associated with longer “on” time. Until recently, success with l-dopa had entirely replaced the use of the ablative surgical therapy pioneered by\n\n\n\nCooper 50 years ago.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['The antiviral agent amantadine (100 mg bid) has mild or moderate benefit for tremor, hypokinesia, and postural symptoms. In some patients, it reduces l-dopa–induced dyskinesias (see further on). Its mechanism of action is unknown but antagonism of NMDA or release of stored dopamine has been proposed. It should be noted that amantadine commonly causes leg swelling, may worsen congestive heart failure, and can have an adverse effect on glaucoma, as well as exaggerate the cognitive changes associated with anticholinergic medications. The use of the centrally acting anticholinesterase, donepezil, is being explored for a possible effect on improving gait stability but requires further study. Finally, the monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, described just below as putative neuroprotective agents, have a beneficial effect on motor fluctuations induced by l-dopa and may have a slight beneficial effect on the main Parkinson symptoms as described in several trials, such as the one reported by', 'A 76-year-old retired banker complains of a shuffling gait with occasional falls over the last year.

Choi\n\n\n\nThe majority of diseases of the respiratory system fall into one of three major categories: (1) obstructive lung diseases; (2) restrictive disorders; and (3) abnormalities of the vasculature. Obstructive lung diseases are most common and primarily include disorders of the airways, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis. Diseases resulting in restrictive pathophysiology include parenchymal lung diseases, abnormalities of the chest wall and pleura, and neuromuscular disease. Disorders of the pulmonary vasculature include pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Although many specific diseases fall into these major categories, both infective and neoplastic processes can affect the respiratory system and result in myriad pathologic findings, including those listed in the three categories above (Table 305-1). Disorders can also be grouped according to gas exchange abnormalities, including hypoxemic, hypercarbic, or combined impairment. However, many diseases of the lung do not manifest as gas exchange abnormalities. As with the evaluation of most patients, the approach to a patient with disease of the respiratory system begins with a thorough history and a focused physical examination. Many patients will subsequently undergo pulmonary function testing, chest imaging, blood and sputum analysis, a variety of serologic or microbiologic studies, and diagnostic procedures, such as bronchoscopy.

The past medical history may alert the physician to the presence of underlying diseases that may affect the choice of therapy or the side effects of treatment. The social history may reveal occupational exposure to carcinogens or habits, such as smoking or alcohol consumption, that may influence the course of disease and its treatment. The family history may suggest an underlying familial cancer predisposition and point out the need to begin surveillance or other preventive therapy for unaffected siblings of the patient. The review of systems may suggest early symptoms of metastatic disease or a paraneoplastic syndrome. The diagnosis of cancer relies most heavily on invasive tissue biopsy and should never be made without obtaining tissue; no noninvasive diagnostic test is sufficient to define a disease process as cancer. Although in rare clinical settings (e.g., thyroid nodules), fine-needle aspiration is an acceptable diagnostic procedure, the diagnosis generally depends on obtaining adequate tissue to permit careful evaluation of the histology of the tumor, its grade, and its invasiveness and to yield further molecular diagnostic information, such as the expression of cell-surface markers or intracellular proteins that typify a particular cancer, or the presence of a molecular marker, such as the t(8;14) translocation of Burkitt’s lymphoma.

In intractable cases, tuberculosis, brucellosis, Lyme disease, hepatitis, bacterial endocarditis, mycoplasmal pneumonia, HIV, EBV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), coxsackie B, and other viral infections, and malaria, hookworm, giardiasis, and other parasitic infections need to be considered in the differential diagnosis, and an inquiry made for their characteristic symptoms, signs, and when appropriate, laboratory findings; however, such infections are infrequently found. There should also be a search for anemia, renal failure, chronic inflammatory disease such as temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica (sedimentation rate); an endocrine survey (thyroid, calcium, and cortisol and testosterone levels) and, in appropriate cases, an evaluation for an occult tumor are also in order in obscure cases. It must be remembered that chronic intoxication with alcohol, barbiturates, or other sedative drugs, some of which are given to suppress nervousness or insomnia, may contribute to fatigability. The rapid and recent onset of fatigue should always suggest the presence of an infection, a disturbance in fluid balance, gastrointestinal bleeding, or rapidly developing circulatory failure of either peripheral or cardiac origin. The features that suggest sleep apnea have been mentioned above and are discussed further in Chap. 18.', 'In light of the pathobiology of the disease, many of the findings are to be expected. The patient is frequently febrile with tachycardia or may have a history of chills and/or sweats. Cough may be either nonproductive or productive of mucoid, purulent, or blood-tinged sputum.

","['48. Chronic cough (defined as that persisting for >8 weeks) is commonly associated with obstructive lung diseases, particularly asthma and chronic bronchitis, as well as “nonrespiratory” diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux and postnasal drip. Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, including IPF, frequently present as a persistent, nonproductive cough. As with dyspnea, all causes of cough are not respiratory in origin, and assessment should encompass a broad differential, including cardiac and gastrointestinal diseases as well as psychogenic causes. Additional Symptoms Patients with respiratory disease may report wheezing, which is suggestive of airways disease, particularly asthma. Hemoptysis can be a symptom of a variety of lung diseases, including infections of the respiratory tract, bronchogenic carcinoma, and pulmonary embolism. In addition, chest pain or discomfort is often thought to be respiratory in origin. As the lung parenchyma is not innervated with pain fibers, pain in the chest from respiratory disorders usually results from either diseases of the parietal pleura (e.g., pneumothorax) or pulmonary vascular diseases (e.g., pulmonary hypertension). As many diseases of the lung can result in strain on\n\n\n\nApproach to the Patient with Disease of the Respiratory System 1662 the right side of the heart, patients may also present with symptoms of cor pulmonale, including abdominal bloating or distention and pedal edema (Chap. 279). Additional History A thorough social history is an essential component of the evaluation of patients with respiratory disease. All patients should be asked about current or previous cigarette smoking, as this exposure is associated with many diseases of the respiratory system, most notably COPD and bronchogenic lung cancer but also a variety of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (e.g., desquamative interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis). For most disorders, longer duration and greater intensity of exposure to cigarette smoke increases the risk of disease. There is growing evidence that “second-hand smoke” is also a risk factor for respiratory tract pathology; for this reason, patients should be asked about parents, spouses, or housemates who smoke. Possible inhalational exposures should be explored, including those at the work place (e.g., asbestos, wood smoke) and those associated with leisure (e.g., excrement from pet birds) (Chap.', 'K. Choi\n\n\n\nThe majority of diseases of the respiratory system fall into one of three major categories: (1) obstructive lung diseases; (2) restrictive disorders; and (3) abnormalities of the vasculature. Obstructive lung diseases are most common and primarily include disorders of the airways, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis. Diseases resulting in restrictive pathophysiology include parenchymal lung diseases, abnormalities of the chest wall and pleura, and neuromuscular disease. Disorders of the pulmonary vasculature include pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Although many specific diseases fall into these major categories, both infective and neoplastic processes can affect the respiratory system and result in myriad pathologic findings, including those listed in the three categories above (Table 305-1). Disorders can also be grouped according to gas exchange abnormalities, including hypoxemic, hypercarbic, or combined impairment. However, many diseases of the lung do not manifest as gas exchange abnormalities. As with the evaluation of most patients, the approach to a patient with disease of the respiratory system begins with a thorough history and a focused physical examination. Many patients will subsequently undergo pulmonary function testing, chest imaging, blood and sputum analysis, a variety of serologic or microbiologic studies, and diagnostic procedures, such as bronchoscopy. This stepwise approach is discussed in detail below. HISTORY Dyspnea and Cough The cardinal symptoms of respiratory disease are dyspnea and cough (Chaps. 47e and 48).']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['For each patient, a detailed history is of utmost importance and can help elucidate what the underlying disease is. Details regarding onset, timing, and precipitants of specific symptoms can help discern one diagnosis from another. History regarding pharmacologic, occupational, and environmental exposures is instructive, and family and travel history are crucial. In addition to details about the sinuses and lungs, it is important to inquire about systemic manifestations and assess for physical findings of cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI), neurologic, dermatologic, and genitourinary involvement, all of which may give clues to specific diagnoses. Once the details from history and physical are teased out, laboratory testing (including measurements of blood eosinophils, cultures, and markers of inflammation), spirometry and radiographic imaging can help distinguish between different diseases.

","['55-3A). When this strategy is unrevealing, simple triage tests are often warranted to direct the choice of more complex investigations (Fig. 55-3B). The history, physical examination (Table 55-4), and routine blood studies should attempt to characterize the mechanism of diarrhea, identify diagnostically helpful associations, and assess the patient’s fluid/electrolyte and nutritional status. Patients should be questioned about the onset, duration, pattern, aggravating (especially diet) and relieving factors, and stool characteristics of their diarrhea. The presence or absence of fecal incontinence, fever, weight loss, pain, certain exposures (travel, medications, contacts with diarrhea), and common extraintestinal manifestations (skin changes, arthralgias, oral aphthous ulcers) should be noted. A family history of IBD or sprue may indicate those possibilities. Physical findings may offer clues such as a thyroid mass, wheezing, heart murmurs, edema, hepatomegaly, abdominal masses, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous abnormalities, perianal fistulas, or anal sphincter laxity. Peripheral blood leukocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein suggests inflammation; anemia reflects blood loss or nutritional deficiencies; or eosinophilia may occur with parasitoses, neoplasia, collagen-vascular disease, allergy, or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Blood chemistries may demonstrate electrolyte, hepatic, or other metabolic disturbances. Measuring IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies may help detect celiac disease. Bile acid diarrhea is confirmed by a scintigraphic radiolabeled bile acid retention test; however, this is not available in many countries. Alternative approaches are a screening blood test (serum C4 or FGF-19), measurement of fecal bile acids, or a therapeutic trial with a bile acid sequestrant (e.g., cholestyramine or colesevelam). A therapeutic trial is often appropriate, definitive, and highly cost-effective when a specific diagnosis is suggested on the initial physician encounter. For example, chronic watery diarrhea, which ceases with fasting in an otherwise healthy young adult, may justify a trial of a lactose-restricted diet; bloating and diarrhea persisting since a mountain backpacking trip may warrant a trial of metronidazole for likely giardiasis; and postprandial diarrhea persisting following resection of terminal ileum might be due to bile acid malabsorption and be treated with cholestyramine or colesevelam before further evaluation. Persistent symptoms require additional investigation. Certain diagnoses may be suggested on the initial encounter (e.g., idiopathic IBD); however, additional focused evaluations may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and characterize the severity or extent of disease so that treatment can be best guided. Patients suspected of having IBS should be initially evaluated with flexible sigmoidoscopy with colorectal biopsies to exclude IBD, or particularly microscopic colitis, which is clinically indistinguishable from IBS with diarrhea; those with normal findings might be reassured and, as indicated, treated empirically with antispasmodics, antidiarrheals, or antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic agents). Any patient who presents with chronic diarrhea and hematochezia should be evaluated with stool microbiologic studies and colonoscopy. In an estimated two-thirds of cases, the cause for chronic diarrhea remains unclear after the initial encounter, and further testing is required.

For secretory diarrheas (watery, normal osmotic gap), possible medication-related side effects or surreptitious laxative use should be reconsidered. Microbiologic studies should be done including fecal bacterial cultures (including media for Aeromonas and Plesiomonas), inspection for ova and parasites, and Giardia antigen assay (the most sensitive test for giardiasis). Small-bowel bacterial overgrowth can be excluded by intestinal aspirates with quantitative cultures or with glucose or lactulose breath tests involving measurement of breath hydrogen, methane, or other metabolite. However, interpretation of these breath tests may be confounded by disturbances of intestinal transit. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies and small-bowel x-rays (formerly barium, but increasingly CT with enterography or magnetic resonance with enteroclysis) are helpful to rule out structural or occult inflammatory disease. When suggested by history or other findings, screens for peptide hormones should be pursued (e.g., serum gastrin, VIP, calcitonin, and thyroid hormone/thyroid-stimulating hormone, urinary 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, histamine). Further evaluation of osmotic diarrhea should include tests for lactose intolerance and magnesium ingestion, the two most common causes. Low fecal pH suggests carbohydrate malabsorption; lactose malabsorption can be confirmed by lactose breath testing or by a therapeutic trial with lactose exclusion and observation of the effect of lactose challenge (e.g., a liter of milk). Lactase determination on small-bowel biopsy is not generally available. If fecal magnesium or laxative levels are elevated, inadvertent or surreptitious ingestion should be considered and psychiatric help should be sought. For those with proven fatty diarrhea, endoscopy with small-bowel biopsy (including aspiration for Giardia and quantitative cultures) should be performed; if this procedure is unrevealing, a small-bowel radiograph is often an appropriate next step. If small-bowel studies are negative or if pancreatic disease is suspected, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency should be excluded with direct tests, such as the secretin-cholecystokinin stimulation test or a variation that could be performed endoscopically. In general, indirect tests such as assay of fecal elastase or chymotrypsin activity or a bentiromide test have fallen out of favor because of low sensitivity and specificity. Chronic inflammatory-type diarrheas should be suspected by the presence of blood or leukocytes in the stool. Such findings warrant stool cultures; inspection for ova and parasites; C. difficile toxin assay; colonoscopy with biopsies; and, if indicated, small-bowel contrast studies. Treatment of chronic diarrhea depends on the specific etiology and may be curative, suppressive, or empirical. If the cause can be eradicated, treatment is curative as with resection of a colorectal cancer, antibiotic administration for Whipple’s disease or tropical sprue, or discontinuation of a drug. For many chronic conditions, diarrhea can be controlled by suppression of the underlying mechanism. Examples include elimination of dietary lactose for lactase deficiency or gluten for celiac sprue, use of glucocorticoids or other anti-inflammatory agents for idiopathic IBDs, bile acid sequestrants for bile acid malabsorption, PPIs for the gastric hypersecretion of gastrinomas, somatostatin analogues such as octreotide for malignant carcinoid syndrome, prostaglandin inhibitors such as indomethacin for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, and pancreatic enzyme replacement for pancreatic insufficiency. When the specific cause or mechanism of chronic diarrhea evades diagnosis, empirical therapy may be beneficial. Mild opiates, such as diphenoxylate or loperamide, are often helpful in mild or moderate watery diarrhea. For those with more severe diarrhea, codeine or tincture of opium may be beneficial. Such antimotility agents should be avoided with severe IBD, because toxic megacolon may be precipitated. Clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, may allow control of diabetic diarrhea, although the medication may be poorly tolerated because it causes postural hypotension. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g., alosetron) may relieve diarrhea and urgency in patients with IBS diarrhea. For all patients with chronic diarrhea, fluid and electrolyte repletion is an important component of management (see “Acute Diarrhea,” earlier). Replacement of fat-soluble vitamins may also be necessary in patients with chronic steatorrhea. PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases\n\n\n\nConstipation is a common complaint in clinical practice and usually refers to persistent, difficult, infrequent, or seemingly incomplete defecation. Because of the wide range of normal bowel habits, constipation is difficult to define precisely. Most persons have at least three bowel movements per week; however, low stool frequency alone is not the sole criterion for the diagnosis of constipation. Many constipated patients have a normal frequency of defecation but complain of excessive straining, hard stools, lower abdominal fullness, or a sense of incomplete evacuation. The individual patient’s symptoms must be analyzed in detail to ascertain what is meant by “constipation” or “difficulty” with defecation. Stool form and consistency are well correlated with the time elapsed from the preceding defecation. Hard, pellety stools occur with slow transit, whereas loose, watery stools are associated with rapid transit. Both small pellety or very large stools are more difficult to expel than normal stools. The perception of hard stools or excessive straining is more difficult to assess objectively, and the need for enemas or digital disimpaction is a clinically useful way to corroborate the patient’s perceptions of difficult defecation. Psychosocial or cultural factors may also be important. A person whose parents attached great importance to daily defecation will become greatly concerned when he or she misses a daily bowel movement; some children withhold stool to gain attention or because of fear of pain from anal irritation; and some adults habitually ignore or delay the call to have a bowel movement. Pathophysiologically, chronic constipation generally results from inadequate fiber or fluid intake or from disordered colonic transit or anorectal function. These result from neurogastroenterologic disturbance, certain drugs, advancing age, or in association with a large number of systemic diseases that affect the GI tract (Table 55-5). Constipation of recent onset may be a symptom of significant organic disease such as tumor or stricture. In idiopathic constipation, a subset of patients exhibit delayed emptying of the ascending and transverse colon with prolongation of transit (often in the proximal colon) and a reduced frequency of propulsive HAPCs. Outlet obstruction to defecation (also called evacuation disorders) accounts for about a quarter of cases presenting with constipation in tertiary care and may cause delayed colonic transit, which is usually corrected by biofeedback retraining of the disordered defecation. Constipation of any cause may be exacerbated by hospitalization or chronic illnesses that lead to physical or mental impairment and result in inactivity or physical immobility. Types of Constipation and Causes Examples\n\n\n\nColonic obstruction Neoplasm; stricture: ischemic, diverticular, inflammatory Anal sphincter spasm Anal fissure, painful hemorrhoids Medications\n\n\n\nDisorders of rectal evacuation\n\n\n\nConstipation-predominant, alternating Ca2+ blockers, antidepressants Slow-transit constipation, megacolon (rare Hirschsprung’s, Chagas’ diseases) Pelvic floor dysfunction; anismus; descending perineum syndrome; rectal mucosal prolapse; rectocele Hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, pregnancy Depression, eating disorders, drugs Parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, spinal\n\n\n\nAPPROACH TO THE PATIENT:\n\n\n\nA careful history should explore the patient’s symptoms and confirm whether he or she is indeed constipated based on frequency (e.g., fewer than three bowel movements per week), consistency (lumpy/hard), excessive straining, prolonged defecation time, or need to support the perineum or digitate the anorectum to facilitate stool evacuation. In the vast majority of cases (probably >90%), there is no underlying cause (e.g., cancer, depression, or hypothyroidism), and constipation responds to ample hydration, exercise, and supplementation of dietary fiber (15–25 g/d). A good diet and medication history and attention to psychosocial issues are key. Physical examination and, particularly, a rectal examination should exclude fecal impaction and most of the important diseases that present with constipation and possibly indicate features suggesting an evacuation disorder (e.g., high anal sphincter tone, failure of perineal descent, or paradoxical puborectalis contraction during straining to simulate stool evacuation). The presence of weight loss, rectal bleeding, or anemia with constipation mandates either flexible sigmoidoscopy plus barium enema or colonoscopy alone, particularly in patients >40 years, to exclude structural diseases such as cancer or strictures. Colonoscopy alone is most cost-effective in this setting because it provides an opportunity to biopsy mucosal lesions, perform polypectomy, or dilate strictures. Barium enema has advantages over colonoscopy in the patient with isolated constipation because it is less costly and identifies colonic dilation and all significant mucosal lesions or strictures that are likely to present with constipation. Melanosis coli, or pigmentation of the colon mucosa, indicates the use of anthraquinone laxatives such as cascara or senna; however, this is usually apparent from a careful history. An unexpected disorder such as megacolon or cathartic colon may also be detected by colonic radiographs. Measurement of serum calcium, potassium, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels will identify rare patients with metabolic disorders. Patients with more troublesome constipation may not respond to fiber alone and may be helped by a bowel-training regimen, which involves taking an osmotic laxative (e.g., magnesium salts, lactulose, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol) and evacuating with enema or suppository (e.g., glycerine or bisacodyl) as needed. After breakfast, a distraction-free 15–20 min on the toilet without straining is encouraged. Excessive straining may lead to development of hemorrhoids, and, if there is weakness of the pelvic floor or injury to the pudendal nerve, may result in obstructed defecation from descending perineum syndrome several years later. Those few who do not benefit from the simple measures delineated above or require long-term treatment or fail to respond to potent laxatives should undergo further investigation (Fig.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['(After TS Steiner, RL Guerrant: Principles and syndromes of enteric infection, in Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett’s Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases, 7th ed, GL Mandell et al [eds].

Examination of a stool sample may supplement the narrative history. Grossly bloody or mucoid stool suggests an inflammatory process. A test for fecal leukocytes (preparation of a thin smear of stool on a glass slide, addition of a drop of methylene blue, and examination of the wet mount) can suggest inflammatory disease in patients with diarrhea, although the predictive value of this test is still debated.

If the headaches are mild, the patient may already have learned that aspirin, acetaminophen, or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) will suffice to control the pain. Insofar as a good response may be obtained from one type of NSAID and not another, it may be advisable to try two or three preparations in several successive attacks of headache and to use moderately high doses if necessary.

"Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.
Methods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose, 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (target dose, 50 mg twice daily). The patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), the previous admission for a cardiovascular indication, an ejection fraction of < 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention-to-treat.
Findings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD, 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (SD, 0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (SD, 11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction in all-cause mortality was consistent across pre-defined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ significantly between the 2 study groups.
Based on the best interpretation of the results of this clinical trial, which of the following statements is most accurate?
A:There is no appreciable, statistically significant difference in overall mortality between the 2 treatment arms.
B:Carvedilol demonstrated a significant improvement in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure as compared to metoprolol.
C:Metoprolol demonstrated a significant improvement in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure compared to carvedilol.
D:The study was underpowered and unable to arrive at a statistically significant conclusion.
E:The results are likely biased due to trial design, and therefore non-generalizable.
","['The past 50 years have witnessed great strides in the management of HFrEF. The treatment of symptomatic heart failure that evolved from a renocentric (diuretics) and hemodynamic therapy model\n\n\n\nFIGURE 280-3 Progressive decline in mortality with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and balanced vasodilators (∗selected populations such as African Americans); further stack-on neurohormonal therapy is ineffective or results in worse outcome; management of comorbidity is of unclear efficacy.

(digoxin, inotropic therapy) ushered in the era of disease-modifying therapy with neurohormonal antagonism. In this regard, ACEIs and beta blockers form the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy and lead to attenuation of decline and improvement in cardiac structure and function with consequent reduction in symptoms, improvement in quality of life, decreased burden of hospitalizations, and a decline in mortality from both pump failure and arrhythmic deaths (Fig. 280-3). Meta-analyses suggest a 23% reduction in mortality and a 35% reduction in the combination endpoint of mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients treated with ACEIs. Patients treated with beta blockers provide a further 35% reduction in mortality on top of the benefit provided by ACEIs alone. Increased experience with both agents in a broad range of patients with HFrEF has demonstrated the safety of ACEIs in treating patients with mild renal insufficiency and the tolerability of beta blockers in patients with moderately controlled diabetes, asthma, and obstructive lung disease. The benefits of ACEIs and beta blockers extend to advanced symptoms of disease (NYHA class IIIb–IV). However, a substantial number of patients with advanced heart failure may not be able to achieve optimal doses of neurohormonal inhibitors and require cautious reduction in dose exposure to maintain clinical stability. Such individuals with lower exposure to ACEIs and beta blockers represent a high-risk cohort with poor prognosis. Class Effect and Sequence of Administration ACEIs exert their beneficial effects in HFrEF as a class; however, the beneficial effects of beta blockers are thought to be limited to specific drugs. Beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (xamoterol) and other agents, including bucindolol, have not demonstrated a survival benefit. On the basis of investigations, beta blocker use in HFrEF should be restricted to carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate—agents tested and proven to improve survival in clinical trials. Whether beta blockers or ACEIs should be started first was answered by the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS) III, in which outcomes did not vary when either agent was initiated first. Thus, it matters little which agent is initiated first; what does matter is that optimally titrated doses of both ACEIs and beta blockers be established in a timely manner. Limits of Pharmacologic Therapy in HFrEF 1511\n\n\n\nDose and Outcome A trial has indicated that higher tolerated doses of ACEIs achieve greater reduction in hospitalizations without materially improving survival. Beta blockers demonstrate a dose-dependent improvement in cardiac function and reductions in mortality and hospitalizations. Clinical experience suggests that, in the absence of symptoms to suggest hypotension (fatigue and dizziness), pharmacotherapy may be up-titrated every 2 weeks in hemodynamically stable and euvolemic ambulatory patients as tolerated. Aldosterone antagonism is associated with a reduction in mortality in all stages of symptomatic NYHA class II to IV HFrEF. Elevated aldosterone levels in HFrEF promote sodium retention, electrolyte imbalance, and endothelial dysfunction and may directly contribute to myocardial fibrosis. The selective agent eplerenone (tested in NYHA class II and post–myocardial infarction heart failure) and the nonselective antagonist spironolactone (tested in NYHA class III and IV heart failure) reduce mortality and hospitalizations, with significant reductions in sudden cardiac death (SCD). Hyperkalemia and worsening renal function are concerns, especially in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease, and renal function and serum potassium levels must be closely monitored. Neurohormonal “escape” has been witnessed in patients with HFrEF by the finding that circulating levels of angiotensin II return to pretreatment levels with long-term ACEI therapy. ARBs blunt this phenomenon by binding competitively to the AT1 receptor. A large meta-analysis of 24 randomized trials showed the superiority of ARBs to placebo in patients with intolerable adverse effects with ACEIs and their noninferiority in all-cause mortality or hospitalizations when compared with ACEIs. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) suggested that addition of valsartan in patients already receiving treatment with ACEIs and beta blockers was associated with a trend toward worse outcomes. Similarly, adding valsartan to captopril in patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction who were receiving background beta blocker therapy was associated with an increase in adverse events without any added benefit compared with 1512 monotherapy for either group. Thus, the initial clinical strategy should be to use a two-drug combination first (ACEI and beta blocker; if beta blocker intolerant, then ACEI and ARB; if ACEI intolerant, then ARB and beta blocker). In symptomatic patients (NYHA class II–IV), an aldosterone antagonist should be strongly considered, but four-drug therapy should be avoided. A recent trial called the Aliskiren Trial on Acute Heart Failure Outcomes (ASTRONAUT) tested a direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, in addition to other heart failure medications, within a week after discharge from a hospitalization for decompensated HFrEF. No significant difference in cardiovascular death or hospitalization at 6 or 12 months was noted. Aliskiren was associated with a reduction in circulating natriuretic peptides, but any disease-modifying effect was overcome by excessive adverse events including hyperkalemia, hypo-tension, and renal dysfunction. The combination of hydralazine and nitrates has been demonstrated to improve survival in HFrEF. Hydralazine reduces systemic vascular resistance and induces arterial vasodilatation by affecting intracellular calcium kinetics; nitrates are transformed in smooth muscle cells into nitric oxide, which stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphate production and consequent arterial-venous vasodilation. This combination improves survival, but not to the magnitude evidenced by ACEIs or ARBs. However, in individuals with HFrEF unable to tolerate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone–based therapy for reasons such as renal insufficiency or hyperkalemia, this combination is preferred as a disease-modifying approach. A trial conducted in self-identified African Americans, the African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-Heft), studied a fixed dose of isosorbide dinitrate with hydralazine in patients with advanced symptoms of HFrEF who were receiving standard background therapy. The study demonstrated benefit in survival and hospitalization recidivism in the treatment group.', 'Parmley, MD, coauthor of this chapter in prior editions. Heart failure is a progressive disease that is characterized by a gradual reduction in cardiac performance, punctuated in many patients by episodes of acute decompensation, often requiring hospitalization. Treatment is therefore directed at two somewhat different goals: (1) reducing symptoms and slowing progression as much as possible during relatively stable periods and (2) managing acute episodes of decompensated failure. These factors are discussed in Clinical Pharmacology of Drugs Used in Heart Failure. Although it is believed that the primary defect in early systolic heart failure resides in the excitation-contraction coupling machinery of the myocardium, the clinical condition also involves many other processes and organs, including the baroreceptor reflex, the sympathetic nervous system, the kidneys, angiotensin II and other peptides, aldosterone, and apoptosis of cardiac cells. Recognition of these factors has resulted in evolution of a variety of drug treatment strategies (Table 13–1) that constitute the current standard of care. Large clinical trials have shown that therapy directed at non-cardiac targets is more valuable in the long-term treatment of heart failure than traditional positive inotropic agents (cardiac glycosides [digitalis]). Large trials have also shown that angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor\n\n\n\nTABLE 13–1 Therapies used in heart failure. blockers (ARBs), certain β blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and combined angiotensin receptor blocker plus neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) therapy are the only agents in current use that actually prolong life and reduce hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure. These strategies are useful in both systolic and diastolic failure. Smaller studies support the use of the hydralazine-nitrate combination in African Americans and the use of ivabradine in patients with persistent tachycardia despite optimal management. Positive inotropic drugs, on the other hand, are helpful mainly in acute systolic failure. Cardiac glycosides also reduce symptoms in chronic systolic heart failure. In large clinical trials to date, other positive inotropic drugs have usually reduced survival in chronic failure or had no benefit, and their use is discouraged. Control of Normal Cardiac Contractility\n\n\n\nThe vigor of contraction of heart muscle is determined by several processes that lead to the movement of actin and myosin filaments in the cardiac sarcomere (Figure 13–1). Ultimately, contraction results from the interaction of activator calcium (during systole) with the actin-troponin-tropomyosin system, thereby releasing the actin-myosin interaction. This activator calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The amount released depends on the amount stored in the SR and on the amount of trigger calcium that enters the cell during the plateau of the action potential. A. Sensitivity of the Contractile Proteins to Calcium and Other Contractile Protein Modifications\n\n\n\nThe determinants of calcium sensitivity, ie, the curve relating the shortening of cardiac myofibrils to the cytoplasmic calcium concentration, are incompletely understood, but several types of drugs can be shown to affect calcium sensitivity in vitro. Levosimendan is a recent example of a drug that increases calcium sensitivity (it may also inhibit phosphodiesterase) and reduces symptoms in models of heart failure. A recent report suggests that an experimental drug, omecamtiv mecarbil (CK-1827452), alters the rate of transition of myosin from a low-actin-binding state to a strongly actin-bound, force-generating state. This action might increase contractility without increasing energy consumption, ie, increase efficiency.']","['The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017)', 'The reduction in all-cause mortality was consistent across pre-defined subgroups.']",0.031746031746031744,"['Clinical trials have demonstrated that at least three β antagonists— metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol—are effective in reducing mortality in selected patients with chronic heart failure.

","['171-3, is unclear. HOST DEFENSE MECHANISMS Innate Immunity As described above, intact respiratory epithelium and a host of nonspecific or innate immune factors (e.g., mucus, splenic function, complement, neutrophils, and macrophages) constitute the first line of defense against pneumococci. Physical factors such as the cough reflex and the mucociliary escalator are important in clearing bacteria from the lungs. Immunologic factors are critical as well: C-reactive protein (CRP) binds phosphorylcholine in the pneumococcal cell wall, inducing complement activation and leading to bacterial clearance; Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognizes both pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid and cell wall peptidoglycan; and in animal models, the absence of host TLR2 leads to more severe infection and impaired clearance of nasopharyngeal colonization. TLR4 appears to be necessary for the proinflammatory effect of pneumolysin on macrophages. The importance of TLR recognition is underlined by descriptions of an inherited deficiency of human IL-1 receptor–associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) that manifests as an unusual susceptibility to infection with bacteria, including S. pneumoniae. IRAK-4 is essential for the normal functioning of several TLRs. Other factors that interfere with these nonspecific mechanisms (e.g., viral infections, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, complement deficiency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) all predispose to the development of pneumococcal pneumonia. Patients who lack a spleen or have abnormal splenic function (e.g., persons with sickle cell disease) are at high risk of developing overwhelming pneumococcal disease. Acquired Immunity Acquired immunity induced via contact following colonization or through cross-reactive antigens rests largely on the development of serum IgG antibody specific for the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide. Nearly all polysaccharides are T cell– independent antigens; B cells can make antibodies to such antigens without T cell help. However, in children <1–2 years old, such B cell responses are poorly developed. This delayed ontogeny of capsule-specific IgG in young children is associated with susceptibility to pneumococcal infection (Fig. 171-5). The extremely high risk of pneumococcal infection in the absence of serum immunoglobulin (i.e., in conditions such as agammaglobulinemia) highlights the important role of capsular antibody in protection against disease. Each serotype’s capsule is chemically distinct; thus immunity tends to be serotype specific, although some cross-immunity exists. For example, conjugate vaccine–induced antibodies to serotype 6B prevent infection due to serotype 6A. However, cross-protection against serotypes within serogroups is not universal; for instance, antibodies to serotype 19F do not appear to confer protection against disease caused by serotype 19A. Antibodies to surface-exposed or secreted pneumococcal proteins (such as pneumolysin, PsaA, and PspA) also appear in the circulation with increasing age of the host, but their functional significance remains unclear. Data from murine models suggest that CD4+ T cells may play a role in preventing pneumococcal colonization and disease, and recent experimental data derived from humans suggest that IL-17-secreting CD4+ T cells may be relevant. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:\n\n\n\nThere is no pathognomonic presentation of pneumococcal disease; patients may present with a range of syndromes and with more than one clinical syndrome (e.g., pneumonia and meningitis).', 'increased incidence of infections with pyogenic bacteria. For example, patients with mutations in MYD88, an adaptor protein required for signaling by Toll-like receptors, are extremely susceptible to severe necrotizing pneumococcal infections, while patients with congenital defects in IgA production (the major immunoglobulin in airways secretions) are at increased risk for pneumonias caused by encapsulated organisms such as pneumococcus and H. influenzae. On the other hand, defects in TH1 cell–mediated immunity lead mainly to increased infections with intracellular microbes such as atypical mycobacteria. Much more commonly, lifestyle choices interfere with host immune defense mechanisms and facilitate infections. For example, cigarette smoke compromises mucociliary clearance and pulmonary macrophage activity, and alcohol impairs neutrophile function as well as cough and epiglottic reflexes (thereby increasing the risk for aspiration). Bacterial pneumonias are classified according to the specific etiologic agent or, if no pathogen can be isolated, by the clinical setting in which the infection occurs. Altogether, seven distinct clinical settings are recognized, each associated with a fairly distinct group of pathogens (summarized in\n\n\n\nTable 13.5 ). Thus, consideration of the clinical setting can be a helpful guide when anti-microbial therapy has to be given empirically. Bacterial pneumonias often follow a viral upper-respiratory tract infection. S. pneumoniae (i.e., the pneumococcus) is the most common cause of community-acquired acute pneumonia and is discussed first, followed by other relative common  pathogens. Pneumococcal infections occur with increased frequency in two clinical settings: (1) chronic diseases such as CHF, COPD, or diabetes; and (2) congenital or acquired defects in immunoglobulin production (e.g., acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]).

","['Treatment in the first instance includes alteration of lifestyle to prevent pain and simple analgesia. As symptoms progress a joint replacement may be necessary, but although joint replacement appears to be the panacea for degenerative joint disease, it is not without risks and complications, which include infection and failure in the short and long term. In the clinic\n\n\n\nExamination of the knee joint\n\n\n\nIt is important to establish the nature of the patient’s complaint before any examination. The history should include information about the complaint, the signs and symptoms, and the patient’s lifestyle (level of activity). This history may give a significant clue to the type of injury and the likely findings on clinical examination, for example, if the patient was kicked around the medial aspect of the knee, a valgus deformity injury to the tibial collateral ligament might be suspected. The examination should include assessment in the erect position, while walking, and on the couch.', 'Patients with mild and intermittent symptoms may need only reassurance or nonpharmacologic treatments. Patients with on-going, disabling pain are likely to need both nonpharmacotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Treatments for knee OA have been more completely evaluated than those for hip and hand OA or for disease in other joints. Thus, although the principles of treatment are identical for OA in all joints, we shall focus below on the treatment of knee OA, noting specific recommendations for disease in other joints, especially when they differ from those for the knee. Because OA is a mechanically driven disease, the mainstay of treatment involves altering loading across the painful joint and improving the function of joint protectors, so they can better distribute load across the joint. Ways of lessening focal load across the joint include: 1. avoiding activities that overload the joint, as evidenced by their causing pain; 2. improving the strength and conditioning of muscles that bridge the joint, so as to optimize their function; and 3. unloading the joint, either by redistributing load within the joint with a brace or a splint or by unloading the joint during weight bearing with a cane or a crutch. The simplest effective treatment for many patients is to avoid activities that precipitate pain. For example, for the middle-aged patient whose long-distance running brings on symptoms of knee OA, a less demanding form of weight-bearing activity may alleviate all symptoms. For an older person whose daily constitutionals up and down hills bring on knee pain, routing the constitutional away from hills might eliminate symptoms. Each pound of weight increases the loading across the knee threeto sixfold. Weight loss may have a commensurate multiplier effect, unloading both knees and hips and probably relieving pain in those joints. In hand joints affected by OA, splinting, by limiting motion, often minimizes pain for patients with involvement especially in the base of the thumb. Weight-bearing joints such as knees and hips can be unloaded by using a cane in the hand opposite to the affected joint for partial weight bearing. A physical therapist can help teach the patient how to use the cane optimally, including ensuring that its height is optimal for unloading. Crutches or walkers can serve a similar beneficial function. Exercise Osteoarthritic pain in knees or hips during weight bearing results in lack of activity and poor mobility, and because OA is so common, the inactivity that results represents a public health concern, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity. Aerobic capacity is poor in most elders with symptomatic knee OA, worse than others of the same age. Weakness in muscles that bridge osteoarthritic joints is multi-factorial in etiology. First, there is a decline in strength with age. Second, with limited mobility comes disuse muscle atrophy. Third, patients with painful knee or hip OA alter their gait so as to lessen loading across the affected joint, and this further diminishes muscle use. Fourth, “arthrogenous inhibition” may occur, whereby contraction of muscles bridging the joint is inhibited by a nerve afferent feedback loop emanating in a swollen and stretched joint capsule; this prevents maximal attainment of voluntary maximal strength. Because adequate muscle strength and conditioning are critical to joint protection, weakness in a muscle that bridges a diseased joint makes the joint more susceptible to further damage and pain. The degree of weakness correlates strongly with the severity of joint pain and the degree of physical limitation. One of the cardinal elements of the treatment of OA is to improve the functioning of muscles surrounding the joint. For knee and hip OA, trials have shown that exercise lessens pain and improves physical function. Most effective exercise regimens consist of aerobic and/or resistance training, the latter of which focuses on strengthening muscles across the joint. Exercises are likely to be effective, especially if they train muscles for the activities a person performs daily. Activities that increase pain in the joint should be avoided, and the exercise regimen needs to be individualized to optimize effectiveness. Range-of-motion exercises, which do not strengthen muscles, and isometric exercises that strengthen muscles, but not through range of motion, are unlikely to be effective by themselves. Low-impact exercises, including water aerobics and water resistance training, are often better tolerated by patients than exercises involving impact loading, such as running or treadmill exercises. A patient should be referred to an exercise class or to a therapist who can create an individualized regimen, and then an individualized home-based regimen can be crafted. In addition to conventional exercise regimens, tai chi may be effective for knee OA. However, there is no strong evidence that patients with hand OA benefit from therapeutic exercise. Adherence over the long term is the major challenge to an exer-2231 cise prescription. In trials involving patients with knee OA, who are engaged in exercise treatment, from a third to over half of patients stopped exercising by 6 months. Less than 50% continued regular exercise at 1 year. The strongest predictor of a patient’s continued exercise is a previous personal history of successful exercise. Physicians should reinforce the exercise prescription at each clinic visit, help the patient recognize barriers to ongoing exercise, and identify convenient times for exercise to be done routinely. The combination of exercise with calorie restriction and weight loss is especially effective in lessening pain. Correction of Malalignment Malalignment in the frontal plane (varusvalgus) markedly increases the stress across the joint, which can lead to progression of disease and to pain and disability (Fig. 394-5). Correcting malalignment, either surgically or with bracing, may relieve pain in persons whose knees are malaligned. Malalignment develops over years as a consequence of gradual anatomic alterations of the joint and bone, and correcting it is often very challeng ing. One way is with a fitted brace, which takes an often varus osteoarthritic knee and straightens it by putting valgus stress across the knee. Unfortunately, many patients are unwilling to wear a realigning knee brace; in addition, in patients with obese legs, braces may slip with usage and lose their realigning effect. They are indicated for willing patients who can learn to put them on correctly and on whom they do not slip. Other ways of correcting malalignment across the knee include the use of orthotics in footwear. Unfortunately, although they may have modest effects on knee alignment, trials have heretofore not demonstrated efficacy of a lateral wedge orthotic versus placebo wedges. Pain from the patellofemoral compartment of the knee can be caused by tilting of the patella or patellar malalignment with the patella riding laterally or medially in the femoral trochlear groove. Using a brace to realign the patella, or tape to pull the patella back into the trochlear sulcus or reduce its tilt, has been shown, when compared to placebo taping in clinical trials, to lessen patellofemoral pain. However, patients may find it difficult to apply tape, and skin irritation from the tape is common. Commercial patellar braces may be a solution, but there is insufficient evidence on their efficacy to recommend them. Although their effect on malalignment is questionable, neoprene sleeves pulled to cover the knee lessen pain and are easy to use and popular among patients. The explanation for their therapeutic effect on pain is unclear. In patients with knee OA, acupuncture produces modest pain relief compared to placebo needles and may be an adjunctive treatment. Although nonpharmacologic approaches to therapy constitute its mainstay, pharmacotherapy serves an important adjunctive role in OA treatment. Available drugs are administered using oral, topical, and intraarticular routes. acetaminophen, Nonsteroidal anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSaIDs), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Inhibitors Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the initial analgesic of choice for patients with OA in knees, hips, or hands. For some patients, it is adequate to control symptoms, in which case more toxic drugs such as NSAIDs can be avoided. Doses up to 1 g three times daily can be used (Table 394-1). NSAIDs are the most popular drugs to treat osteoarthritic pain. They can be administered either topically or orally. In clinical trials, oral NSAIDs produce ~30% greater improvement in pain than high-dose acetaminophen. Occasional patients treated with NSAIDs experience dramatic pain relief, whereas others experience little improvement. Initially, NSAIDs should be administered topically or taken orally on an “as needed” basis because side effects are less frequent with low intermittent doses. If occasional medication use is insufficiently effective, then daily treatment may be indicated, with\n\n\n\nAcetaminophen Up to 1 g tid Prolongs half-life of warfarin. Make sure patient is not taking other treatments containing acetaminophen to avoid hepatic toxicity. aPatients at high risk include those with previous gastrointestinal events, persons ≥60 years, and persons taking glucocorticoids. Trials have shown the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors and misoprostol in the prevention of ulcers and bleeding. Misoprostol is associated with a high rate of diarrhea and cramping; therefore, proton pump inhibitors are more widely used to reduce NSAID-related gastrointestinal symptoms.

Carefully palpate pulses and auscultate for bruits. Measurement of ankle and brachial systolic BP (ankle-brachial index, or ABI) can provide objective evidence of atherosclerosis (rest pain usually occurs with an ABI < 0.4). A high ABI can indicate calcification of the arteries. Doppler ultrasound helps identify stenosis and occlusion. Doppler ankle systolic pressure readings that are > 90% of brachial readings are normal. Arteriography and digital subtraction angiography are necessary for surgical evaluation.

Acute: analgesics, NSAIDs, acetaminophen.', 'As mentioned above, if the pain does not abate in 12 to 24 h, corticosteroids in any of several regimens may be added and continued for several days. Based on the action of certain peptides in the trigeminovascular complex, novel antagonists of CGRP have been investigated, and while symptomatically equivalent to triptans (Olesen and colleagues and also Ho et al), they have been largely abandoned because of liver toxicity with frequent use. Drugs of this type as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitors and receptor blockers that work by a different mechanism than do the serotonin agonists may be alternatives in the future. In individuals with frequent migrainous attacks, efforts at prevention are worthwhile. The survey by Lipton and colleagues, found approximately one-fourth of patients were appropriate for some form of prophylactic treatment on the basis of the frequency and severity of their headaches, usually more than one severe episode per week. The most effective agents have been beta-adrenergic blockers, certain antiepileptic drugs, and tricyclic antidepressants. Often, comorbidities such as depression, hypertension, epilepsy, or coronary artery disease guide the choice among these three classes of drugs. Some headache specialists have expressed the opinion that amitryptiline may be more effective if headaches are very frequent and that propranolol is more effective if severity of headaches is the concern. Ziegler and colleagues found propranolol and amityrptiline to be equally effective as preventive measures. Some success has been obtained with propranolol, beginning with 10 to 20 mg two to three times daily and increasing the dosage gradually to as much as 240 mg daily, probably best given as a long-acting preparation in the higher dosage ranges. Under-dosing is a major reason for ineffectiveness. If propranolol is unsuccessful or not tolerated, one of the other beta-blockers, specifically those that lack agonist properties—atenolol (40 to 160 mg/d), timolol (20 to 40 mg/d), or metoprolol (100 to 200 mg/d)—may be effective. Many practitioners have found that particularly young patients do not tolerate the fatigue and other side effects of these medications. Alternatives, depending upon other comorbidities, are an antiepileptic medication, or our preference, a tricyclic antidepressant. Valproic acid 250 mg taken three to four times daily, other antiepileptic drug such as topiramate, or amitriptyline, 25 to 125 mg nightly may be tried. The newer antidepressants (e.g., specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are not as effective and may even cause headache in our experience. If these three main approaches are unsuccessful, calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, 320 to 480 mg/d; nifedipine, 90 to 360 mg/d) are also reportedly effective in decreasing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks in some patients, but there is typically a lag of several weeks before benefit is attained and our success with them has been limited. Indomethacin, 150 to 200 mg/d; and cyproheptadine, 4 to 16 mg/nightly are found to be helpful in some patients and may be particularly useful in preventing predictable attacks of perimenstrual migraine. A typical experience is for one of these medications to reduce the number and severity of headaches for several months and then to become less effective, whereupon an increase in the dosage, if tolerated, may help; or one of the many alternatives can be tried. The newest putative treatment for chronic or frequently repeating headaches, both migraine and tension, is the injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) into sensitive temporalis and other cranial muscles. Elimination of headaches for 2 to 4 months has been reported—a claim that justifies further study. Similarly, injection blockade of one or both greater occipital nerves or upper cervical roots has reportedly been helpful. Surgical decompression of sensory nerves in the scalp and related techniques have also been advocated but without documentation. Methysergide, an ergot derivative that was more widely used in the past, in doses of 2 to 6 mg daily for several weeks or months had been effective in the prevention of migraine.

","['To optimize oxygen delivery, nasal O2 and blood transfusions may be given. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given to provide sufficient coverage for enteric pathogens, including gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. Frequent monitoring of the patient’s vital signs, urine output, blood gases, and lactate levels is paramount, as is frequent abdominal examination. All vasoconstricting agents should be avoided; fluid resuscitation is the intervention of choice to maintain hemodynamics. If ischemic colitis is a concern, colonoscopy should be performed to assess the integrity of the colon mucosa. Visualization of the rectosigmoid region may demonstrate decreased mucosal integrity, associated more commonly with nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, or, on occasion, occlusive disease as a result of acute loss of inferior mesenteric arterial flow following aortic surgery. Ischemia of the colonic mucosa is graded as mild with minimal mucosal erythema or as moderate with pale mucosal ulcerations and evidence of extension to the muscular layer of the bowel wall. Severe ischemic colitis presents with severe ulcerations resulting in black or green discoloration of the mucosa, consistent with full-thickness bowel-wall necrosis. The degree of reversibility can be predicted from the mucosal findings: mild erythema is nearly 100% reversible, moderate is approximately 50% reversible, and frank necrosis is simply dead bowel. Follow-up colonoscopy can be performed to rule out progression of ischemic colitis. Laparotomy for nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is warranted for signs of peritonitis or worsening endoscopic findings and if the patient’s condition does not improve with aggressive resuscitation. Ischemic colitis is optimally treated with resection of the ischemic bowel and formation of a proximal stoma. Primary anastomosis should not be performed in patients with acute intestinal ischemia. Patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis may present with a gradual or sudden onset. Symptoms include vague abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Examination findings include abdominal distention with mild to moderate tenderness and signs of dehydration. The diagnosis of mesenteric thrombosis is frequently made on abdominal spiral CT with oral and IV contrast. Findings on CT angiography with venous phase include bowel-wall thickening and ascites. Intravenous contrast will demonstrate a delayed arterial phase and clot within the superior mesenteric vein. The goal of management is to optimize hemodynamics and correct electrolyte abnormalities with massive fluid resuscitation. Intravenous antibiotics as well as anticoagulation should be initiated. If laparotomy is performed and 1981 mesenteric venous thrombosis is suspected, heparin anticoagulation is Acute intestinal obstruction immediately initiated, and compromised bowel is resected. Of all acute\n\n\n\nDanny O. Jacobs intestinal disorders, mesenteric venous insufficiency is associated with the best prognosis. Chronic intestinal ischemia presents with intestinal angina or postprandial abdominal pain associated with need for increased blood flow to the intestine following meals. Patients report abdominal cramping and pain following ingestion of a meal. Weight loss and chronic diarrhea may also be noted. Abdominal pain without weight loss is not chronic mesenteric angina. Physical examination will often reveal a malnourished patient with an abdominal bruit as well as other manifestations of atherosclerosis. Duplex ultrasound evaluation of the mesenteric vessels has gained in popularity. It is important to perform the test fasting because the presence of increased bowel gas prevents adequate visualization of flow disturbances within the vessels or the lack of a vasodilation response to feeding during the test. This tool is frequently used as a screening test for patients with symptoms suggestive of chronic mesenteric ischemia. The gold standard for confirmation of mesenteric arterial occlusion is mesenteric angiography. Evaluation with mesenteric angiography allows for identification and possible intervention for the treatment of atherosclerosis within the vessel lumen and will also evaluate the patency of remaining mesenteric vessels. The use of mesenteric angiography may be limited in the presence of renal failure or contrast allergy. Magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative if the administration of contrast dye is contraindicated. The management of chronic intestinal ischemia includes medical management of atherosclerotic disease by exercise, cessation of smoking, and antiplatelet and lipid-lowering medications. A full cardiac evaluation should be performed before intervention on chronic mesenteric ischemia. Newer endovascular procedures may avoid an operative intervention in selected patient populations. Angioplasty with endovascular stenting in the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia is associated with an 80% long-term success rate. In patients requiring surgical exploration, the approach used is determined by findings of the mesenteric angiogram. The entire length of the small and large bowel should be evaluated, beginning at the ligament of Treitz. Restoration of blood flow at the time of laparotomy is accomplished with mesenteric vessel endarterectomy or bypass. Determination of intestinal viability intraoperatively in patients with suspected intestinal ischemia can be challenging. After revascularization, the bowel wall should be observed for return of a pink color and peristalsis. Palpation of major arterial mesenteric vessels can be performed, as well as applying a Doppler flowmeter to the antimesenteric border of the bowel wall, but neither is a definitive indicator of viability. In equivocal cases, 1 g of IV sodium fluorescein is administered, and the pattern of bowel reperfusion is observed under ultraviolet illumination with a standard (3600 A) Wood’s lamp. An area of nonfluorescence >5 mm in diameter suggests nonviability. If doubt persists, reexploration performed 24–48 h following surgery will allow demarcation of nonviable bowel. Primary intestinal anastomosis in patients with ischemic bowel is always worrisome; thus, delayed bowel reconstruction and reanastomosis should be deferred to the time of second-look laparotomy.

New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005: 1804.)\n\n\n\nFor partial obstruction, supportive care may be sufficient and should include NPO status, NG suction, IV hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and Foley catheterization to monitor ﬂ uid status. Surgery is required in cases of complete SBO, vascular compromise (necrotic bowel), or symptoms lasting > 3 days without resolution. Exploratory laparotomy may be performed with lysis of adhesions, resection of necrotic bowel, and evaluation for stricture, IBD, and hernias. There is a 2% mortality risk for a nonstrangulated SBO; strangulated SBO is associated with up to a 25% mortality rate depending on the time between diagnosis and treatment. A second-look laparotomy or laparoscopy may be performed 18–36 hours after initial surgical treatment to reevaluate bowel viability if ischemia is a concern. Loss of peristalsis without structural obstruction. Risk factors include recent surgery/GI procedures, severe medical illness, immobility, hypokalemia or other electrolyte imbalances, hypothyroidism, DM, and medications that slow GI motility (e.g., anticholinergics, opioids). Presenting symptoms include diffuse, constant, moderate abdominal discomfort; nausea and vomiting (especially with eating); and an absence of fatulence or bowel movements. Exam may reveal diffuse tenderness and abdominal distention, no peritoneal signs, and ↓ or absent bowel sounds. A rectal exam is required to rule out fecal impaction in elderly patients.

Temporarily ↓ or discontinue oral feeds. Initiate NG suction/parenteral feeds as necessary. Replete electrolytes as needed. ↓ mesenteric blood supply leading to insufficient perfusion to intestinal tissue and ischemic injury. Causes include acute arterial occlusion (usually involving the SMA) from thrombosis (due to atherosclerosis) or embolism (due to atrial fibrillation or ↓ ejection fraction); nonocclusive arterial disease (low cardiac output, arteriolar vasospasm); and venous thrombosis (due to hypercoagulable states). Patients present with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain out of proportion to the exam. A history of prior episodes of similar abdominal pain after eating (“intestinal angina”) may be present. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloody stools. Early abdominal exam is often unremarkable; later findings may include peritoneal signs (suggest bowel infarction). Lab tests may show leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis with ↑ lactate, ↑ amylase, ↑ LDH, and ↑ CK. AXR and CT may reveal bowel wall edema (“thumbprinting”) and air within the bowel wall (pneumatosis intestinalis). Mesenteric angiography is the gold standard for arterial occlusive disease.

Diverticulosis is the most common cause of acute lower GI bleeding in patients > 40 years of age. Risk factors include a low-fber and high-fat diet, advanced age (65% occur in those > 80 years of age), and connective tissue disorders (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Diverticulitis is due to inﬂammation and, potentially, perforation of a diverticulum 2° to fecalith impaction. Diverticulosis is often asymptomatic. Bleeding is painless and sudden, generally presenting as hematochezia with symptoms of anemia (fatigue, lightheadedness, dyspnea on exertion). Diverticulitis presents with LLQ abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Perforation is a serious complication that leads to peritonitis and shock. CBC may show leukocytosis. Diagnosis is based on AXR (to rule out free air, ileus, or obstruction), colonoscopy, or barium enema. Sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy must be avoided in those with early diverticulitis due to the risk of perforation. In patients with severe disease or in those who show lack of improvement, abdominal CT may reveal abscess or free air. Uncomplicated diverticulosis: Patients can be followed and placed on a high-f ber diet or fiber supplements. Diverticular bleeding: Bleeding usually stops spontaneously; transfuse and hydrate as needed. If bleeding does not stop, angiography with embolization or surgery is indicated. Diverticulitis: Treat with bowel rest (NPO), NG tube placement, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole and a ﬂuoroquinolone or a secondor third-generation cephalosporin) if the patient is stable. Avoid barium enema and ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy if diverticulitis is suspected. ■For perforation, perform immediate surgical resection of diseased bowel via a Hartmann’s procedure with a temporary colostomy.

In addition, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses play important roles in tissue damage in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (Chaps. 380 and 385). Clinical assessment of immunity requires investigation of the four major components of the immune system that participate in host defense and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases: (1) humoral immunity (B cells); (2) cell-mediated immunity (T cells, monocytes); (3) phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system (macrophages), as well as polymorphonuclear leukocytes; and (4) complement. Clinical problems that require an evaluation of immunity include chronic infections, recurrent infections, unusual infecting agents, and certain autoimmune syndromes. The type of clinical syndrome under evaluation can provide information regarding possible immune defects (Chap. 374). Defects in cellular immunity generally result in viral, mycobacterial, and fungal infections. An extreme example of deficiency in cellular immunity is AIDS (Chap. 226). Antibody deficiencies result in recurrent bacterial infections, frequently with organisms such as S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (Chap. 374). Disorders of phagocyte function are frequently manifested by recurrent skin infections, often due to Staphylococcus aureus (Chap. 80).

Whenever infection is suspected, synovial fluid should be Gram stained and cultured appropriately. If gonococcal arthritis is suspected, nucleic acid amplification tests should be used to detect either Chlamydia trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae infection. Synovial fluid from patients withchronicmonarthritisshouldalsobeculturedfor M. tuberculosis and fungi. Last, it should be noted that crystal-induced arthritis and septic arthritis occasionally occur together in the same joint. Conventional radiography has been a valuable tool in the diagnosis and staging of articular disorders. Plain x-rays are most appropriate and cost effective when there is a history of trauma, suspected chronic infection, progressive disability, or monarticular involvement; when therapeutic alterations are considered; or when a baseline assessment is desired for what appears to be a chronic process. However, in acute inflammatory arthritis, early radiography is rarely helpful in establishinga diagnosisand may only reveal soft tissueswelling or juxtaarticular demineralization.Asthediseaseprogresses,calcification(ofsofttissues, cartilage,orbone),jointspacenarrowing,erosions,bonyankylosis,new bone formation (sclerosis, osteophytes, or periostitis), or subchondral cysts may develop and suggest specific clinical entities. Consultation with a radiologist will help define the optimal imaging modality, technique, or positioning and prevent the need for further studies. Additional imaging techniques may possess greater diagnostic sensitivity and facilitate early diagnosis in a limited number of articular disorders and in selected circumstances and are indicated when conventional radiography is inadequate or nondiagnostic (Table 393-5). Ultrasonography is useful in the detection of soft tissue abnormalities, such as tendinitis, tenosynovitis, enthesitis, bursitis, and entrapment neuropathies. Wider use, lower cost, better technology, and enhanced site-specific transducers now allow for routine use in outpatient care. Owing to low cost, portability, and wider use, ultrasound use has grown and is the preferred method for the evaluation of synovial (Baker’s) cysts, rotator cuff tears, tendinitis and tendon injury, and\n\n\n\nApproach to Articular and Musculoskeletal Disorders\n\n\n\nStrongly consider synovial fluid aspiration and analysis if there is\n\n\n\nTrauma with joint effusion\n\n\n\nMonarthritis in a patient with chronic polyarthritis\n\n\n\nSuspicion of joint infection, crystal-induced arthritis, or hemarthrosis\n\n\n\nAnalyze fluid for • Appearance, viscosity• WBC count, differential• Gram stain, culture, and sensitivity (if indicated)• Crystal identification by polarized microscopyInflammatory ornoninflammatoryarticular condition Consider• Trauma or mechanical derangement• Coagulopathy• Neuropathic arthropathy• OtherIs the WBC > 2000/˜L?

"A 37-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this patient?
A:Palmar surface of the little finger
B:Lateral aspect of the forearm
C:Fingertip of the index finger
D:Medial aspect of the forearm
E:Dorsum of the thumb
","['Clawing is most pronounced in the medial fingers because the function of all intrinsic muscles of these digits is lost while in the lateral two digits, the lumbricals are innervated by the median nerve. Function of the adductor pollicis muscle is also lost. In lesions of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, function of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and flexor digitorum profundus to the medial two digits is lost as well. Clawing of the hand, particularly of the little and ring fingers, is worse with lesions of the ulnar nerve at the wrist than at the elbow because interruption of the nerve at the elbow paralyzes the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus, which leads to lack of flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints in these fingers. Ulnar nerve lesions at the elbow and wrist result in impaired sensory innervation on the palmar aspect of the medial one and one-half digits. Damage to the ulnar nerve at the wrist or at a site proximal to the wrist can be distinguished by evaluating the status of function of the dorsal branch (cutaneous) of the ulnar nerve, which originates in distal regions of the forearm. This branch innervates skin over the dorsal surface of the hand on the medial side. In the clinic\n\n\n\nAround the elbow joint the radial nerve divides into its two terminal branches—the superficial branch and the deep branch. The most common radial nerve injury is damage to the nerve in the radial groove of the humerus, which produces a global paralysis of the muscles of the posterior compartment, resulting in wrist drop. Radial nerve damage can result from fracture of the shaft of the humerus as the radial nerve spirals around in the radial groove. The typical injury produces reduction of sensation in the cutaneous distribution, predominantly over the posterior aspect of the hand. Severing the posterior interosseous nerve (continuation of deep branch of radial nerve) may paralyze the muscles of the posterior compartment of the forearm, but the nerve supply is variable. Typically, the patient may not be able to extend the fingers. The distal branches of the superficial branch of the radial nerve can be readily palpated as “cords” passing over the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus in the anatomical snuffbox. Damage to these branches is of little consequence because they supply only a small area of skin. A 57-year-old woman underwent a right mastectomy for a breast cancer. The surgical note reported that all of the breast tissue had been removed, including the axillary process. In addition, the surgeon had dissected all lymph nodes within the axilla with their surrounding fat. The patient made an uneventful recovery. At the first follow-up appointment, the patient’s husband told the surgeon that she had now developed a bony “spike” on her back. The surgeon was intrigued and asked the patient to reveal this spike. At examination, the spike was the inferior angle of the scapula, which appeared to be sticking out posteriorly (“winged”). Raising the arms accentuated this structure. The medial border of the scapula was accentuated and it was noted that there was some loss of bulk of the serratus anterior muscle, which attaches to the tip of the scapula. The nerve to this muscle was damaged. During the surgery on the axilla, the long thoracic nerve was damaged as it passed down the lateral thoracic wall on the external surface of the serratus anterior, just deep to the skin and subcutaneous fascia. Because the nerve was transected, it is unlikely that the patient will improve, but she was happy that she had an adequate explanation for the spike.', 'Sensory loss is limited to the ulnar border of the hand and the inner forearm; if the first thoracic motor root is involved, there may be an associated paralysis of the cervical sympathetic nerves with a Horner syndrome. Invasion of the lower plexus by tumors is usually painful; postradiation lesions are more likely to cause paresthesias without pain (Lederman and Wilbourn, 1984). Infraclavicular Lesions Involving Cords of the Brachial Plexus (See Fig. 43-5)\n\n\n\nA lesion of the lateral cord causes weakness of the muscles supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve and the lateral root of the median nerve; it manifests mainly as a weakness of flexion and pronation of the forearm. The intrinsic muscles of the hand innervated by the medial root of the median nerve are spared. A lesion of the medial cord of the plexus causes weakness of muscles supplied by the medial root of the median nerve and the ulnar nerve. The effect is that of a combined median and ulnar nerve palsy. A lesion of the posterior cord results in weakness of the deltoid muscle, extensors of the elbow, wrist, and fingers, and sensory loss on the outer surface of the upper arm. One group of infraclavicular injuries, often iatrogenic, results from damage to the subclavian or axillary vessels and the formation of pseudoaneurysms or hematomas. Small puncture wounds—as might occur with catheterization of the subclavian vein, anesthetic block of the brachial plexus, or transaxillary arteriography—are likely to produce this type of injury. As mentioned earlier, thrombosis of the vessels of the neurovascular subclavian bundle are a rare cause. Other frequent causes of injury to the cords are dislocation of the head of the humerus, direct axillary trauma (stab wounds), and supraclavicular compression during awkward positioning of the arm in an operation. Any cords of the plexus may be injured or they may be affected in various combinations. This subject is discussed extensively in Chap.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Examination of the nerves\n\n\n\nThe three main nerves to the hand should be tested.\n\n\n\nThe median nerve innervates the skin on the palmar aspect of the lateral three and one-half digits, the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx, half of the middle phalanges of the same fingers, and a variable amount on the radial side of the palm of the hand.

Peripheral Blood Smear The peripheral blood smear provides important information about defects in red cell production (Chap. 81e). As a complement to the red cell indices, the blood smear also reveals variations in cell size (anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocytosis). The degree of anisocytosis usually correlates with increases in the RDW or the range of cell sizes. Poikilocytosis suggests a defect in the maturation of red cell precursors in the bone marrow or fragmentation of circulating red cells. The blood smear may also reveal polychromasia—red cells that are slightly larger than normal and grayish blue in color on the Wright-Giemsa stain. These cells are reticulocytes that have been prematurely released from the bone marrow, and their color represents residual amounts of ribosomal RNA. These cells appear in circulation in response to EPO stimulation or to architectural damage of the bone marrow (fibrosis, infiltration of the marrow by malignant cells, etc.) that results in their disordered release from the marrow.

With peripartum onset (pp. 186—187)\n\n\n\nWith seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only) (pp. 187—188)\n\n\n\nThe criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly every day to be considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. De- pressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly ev- ery day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be de- demeanor. With individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should de- termine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive symptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psy- chomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall sever- ity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activi- ties (Criterion A). In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad. The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list that includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased en- ergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making deci- sions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To count toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must have clearly worsened compared with the person’s pre-episode status. The symptoms must persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep- isode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu- pational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort. The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or ""down in the dumps"" (Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out that the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain of feeling ”blah,” having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person’s facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals em— phasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be dif- ferentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individ- uals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, “not caring anymore,” or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a for- merly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to practice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sex- ual interest or desire. Appetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individ- uals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave specific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3). Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping exces- sively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle in- somnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep).

","['She tells the pediatrician that the movements started ~1 week ago, are most apparent in the morning, and disappear shortly after eating. Focused History: JS is the product of a normal pregnancy and delivery. He appeared normal at birth. On his growth charts, he has been at the 30th percentile for both weight and length since birth. His immunizations are up to date. JS last ate a few hours ago. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): JS appears sleepy and feels clammy to the touch. His respiratory rate is elevated. His temperature is normal. JS has a protuberant, firm abdomen that appears to be nontender. His liver is palpable 4 cm below the right costal margin and is smooth. His kidneys are enlarged and symmetrical. Pertinent Test Results:\n\n\n\nH = High; L = Low. JS is sent to the regional children’s hospital for further evaluation. Ultrasound studies confirm hepatomegaly and renomegaly and show no evidence of tumors. A liver biopsy is performed. The hepatocytes are distended. Staining reveals large amounts of lipid (primarily triacylglycerol) and carbohydrate. Liver glycogen is elevated in amount and normal in structure. Enzyme assay using liver homogenate treated with detergent reveals <10% of the normal activity of glucose 6-phosphatase, an enzyme of the endoplasmic reticular (ER) membrane in the liver and the kidneys. Diagnosis: JS has glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency (glycogen storage disease [GSD] type Ia, von Gierke disease). Treatment (Immediate): JS was given glucose intravenously, and his blood glucose level rose into the normal range. However, as the day progressed, it fell to well below normal. Administration of glucagon had no effect on blood glucose levels but increased blood lactate. JS’s blood glucose levels were able to be maintained by constant infusion of glucose. Prognosis: Individuals with glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency develop hepatic adenomas starting in the second decade of life and are at increased risk for hepatic carcinoma. Kidney glomerular function is impaired and can result in kidney failure. Patients are at increased risk for developing gout, but this rarely occurs before puberty. Nutrition Nugget: Long-term medical nutrition therapy for JS is designed to maintain his blood glucose levels in the normal range. Frequent (every 2–3 hours) daytime feedings rich in carbohydrate (provided by uncooked cornstarch that is slowly hydrolyzed) and nighttime nasogastric infusion (pump assisted) of glucose are advised. Avoidance of fructose and galactose is recommended because they are metabolized to glycolytic intermediates and lactate, which can exacerbate the metabolic problems. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are prescribed. Genetics Gem: GSD Ia is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by >100 known mutations to the gene for glucose 6-phosphatase located on chromosome 17. It has an incidence of 1:100,000 and accounts for ~25% of all cases of GSD in the United States. It is one of the few genetic causes of hypoglycemia in newborns. GSD Ia is not routinely screened for in newborns. [Note: Deficiency of the translocase that moves glucose 6phosphate into the ER is the cause of GSD Ib. Hypoglycemia and neutropenia are seen.]\n\n\n\nReview Questions: Choose the ONE best answer.', 'A pathologic process in the nervous system is reliably ascertained by the obvious progression of a neurologic disorder, such as a loss of ability to walk and to speak, which usually parallels a regression in other high-level (quasi-intellectual) functions. Embryologic anomalies, prenatal diseases, and birth injuries can be excluded with relative certainty if psychomotor development was normal in the first year or two. Diseases characterized by seizures and myoclonus may prove more difficult to interpret, for the seizures may occur at any age from a variety of distant or immediate neurologic causes and, if frequent, may cause a significant impairment of psychomotor function. The effects of anticonvulsant medications may add to the impairment of cortical function. Unfortunately, most of the slowly advancing metabolic diseases of the second year may be so subtle in their effects that for a time the physician cannot be sure whether a regression of intellectual functions is taking place or mental retardation or autism is becoming apparent for the first time. An added difficulty arises when, for a number of years, the hereditary metabolic abnormality merely slows development. Repeated examinations and testing will usually settle the matter. Suspicion of a progressive encephalopathy is heightened by the presence of certain ocular, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities, as described below. Once a neurologic syndrome is clearly established, there is a particular advantage in determining whether its main characteristics reflect a disorder of the cerebral white matter (oligodendrocytes and myelin) or of gray matter (neurons). Indicative of predominantly white matter affection (leukodystrophy or leukoencephalopathy) are early onset of spastic paralysis of the limbs, with or without ataxia, and visual impairment with optic atrophy but normal retinae. Seizures and intellectual deterioration are late events. MRI usually confirms the involvement of white matter. Indicative of gray matter disease (poliodystrophy or polioencephalopathy) are the early onset of seizures, myoclonus, blindness with retinal changes, and mental regression. Choreoathetosis and ataxia, spastic paralysis, and signs of sensorimotor tract involvement occur later. On MRI, only a generalized atrophy and ventricular enlargement may be seen. Neuronal storage diseases, such as those described in the previous section, as well as neuroaxonal dystrophy and the lipofuscinoses, conform to the pattern of gray matter diseases (see Table 36-5). Metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid-cell (Krabbe) disease, sudanophilic leukodystrophy, and spongy degeneration of infancy (Canavan disease) exemplify white matter diseases (see Table 36-6). Although this mode of categorization is helpful, there is some degree of overlap; for example, Tay-Sachs disease, a poliodystrophy, also causes white matter changes, and metachromatic leukodystrophy may be accompanied by some degree of neuronal storage. The following are inherited metabolic diseases that become evident clinically in late infancy and early childhood: 1. Many of the milder disorders of amino acid metabolism 2. Metachromatic and other leukodystrophies 3. Late infantile GM1 gangliosidosis 4. Late infantile Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick disease 5. Neuroaxonal dystrophy 6. The mucopolysaccharidoses 7.

Polycystic ovary with prominent multiple cysts. (Reproduced, with permission, from DeCherney AH.', 'c. Primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance (Chrousos syndrome)—This rare sporadic or familial genetic condition is usually due to inactivating mutations of the glucocorticoid receptor gene. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperfunctions in an attempt to compensate for the defect, and the increased production of ACTH leads to high circulating levels of cortisol and cortisol precursors such as corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone with mineralocorticoid activity, as well as of adrenal androgens. These increased levels may result in hypertension with or without hypokalemic alkalosis and hyperandrogenism expressed as virilization and precocious puberty in children and acne, hirsutism, male pattern baldness, and menstrual irregularities (mostly oligo-amenorrhea and hypofertility) in women. The therapy of this syndrome is high doses of synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone with no inherent mineralocorticoid activity. These doses are titrated to normalize the production of cortisol, cortisol precursors, and adrenal androgens. d. Aldosteronism—Primary aldosteronism usually results from the excessive production of aldosterone by an adrenal adenoma. However, it may also result from abnormal secretion by hyper-plastic glands or from a malignant tumor. The clinical findings of hypertension, weakness, and tetany are related to the continued renal loss of potassium, which leads to hypokalemia, alkalosis, and elevation of serum sodium concentrations. This syndrome can also be produced in disorders of adrenal steroid biosynthesis by excessive secretion of deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, or 18-hydroxycorticosterone—all compounds with inherent mineralocorticoid activity. In contrast to patients with secondary aldosteronism (see text that follows), these patients have low (suppressed) levels of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II. When treated with fludrocortisone (0.2 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) or deoxycorticosterone acetate (20 mg/d intramuscularly for 3 days—but not available in the United States), patients fail to retain sodium and the secretion of aldosterone is not significantly reduced. When the disorder is mild, it may escape detection if serum potassium levels are used for screening. However, it may be detected by an increased ratio of plasma aldosterone to renin. Patients generally improve when treated with spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor-blocking agent, and the response to this agent is of diagnostic and therapeutic value. 3. Use of glucocorticoids for diagnostic purposes—It is sometimes necessary to suppress the production of ACTH to identify the source of a particular hormone or to establish whether its production is influenced by the secretion of ACTH. In these circumstances, it is advantageous to use a very potent substance such as dexamethasone because the use of small quantities reduces the possibility of confusion in the interpretation of hormone assays in blood or urine. For example, if complete suppression is achieved by the use of 50 mg of cortisol, the urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids will be 15–18 mg/24 h, since one-third of the dose given will be recovered in urine as 17-hydroxycorticosteroid. If an equivalent dose of 1.5 mg of dexamethasone is used, the urinary excretion will be only 0.5 mg/24 h and blood levels will be low. The dexamethasone suppression test is used for the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome and has also been used in the differential diagnosis of depressive psychiatric states. As a screening test, 1 mg dexamethasone is given orally at 11 pm, and a plasma sample is obtained the following morning. In normal individuals, the morning cortisol concentration is usually <3 mcg/dL, whereas in Cushing’s syndrome the level is usually >5 mcg/dL. The results are not reliable in the patient with depression, anxiety, concurrent illness, and other stressful conditions or in the patient who is receiving a medication that enhances the catabolism of dexamethasone in the liver. To distinguish between hypercortisolism due to anxiety, depression, and alcoholism (pseudo-Cushing syndrome) and bona fide Cushing’s syndrome, a combined test is carried out, consisting of dexamethasone (0.5 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days) followed by a standard corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) test (1 mg/kg given as a bolus intravenous infusion 2 hours after the last dose of dexamethasone). In patients in whom the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome has been established clinically and confirmed by a finding of elevated free cortisol in the urine, suppression with large doses of dexamethasone will help to distinguish patients with Cushing’s disease from those with steroid-producing tumors of the adrenal cortex or with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Dexamethasone is given in a dosage of 0.5 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by 2 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days, and the urine is then assayed for cortisol or its metabolites (Liddle’s test); or dexamethasone is given as a single dose of 8 mg at 11 pm, and the plasma cortisol is measured at 8 am the following day. In patients with Cushing’s disease, the suppressant effect of dexamethasone usually produces a 50% reduction in hormone levels. In patients in whom suppression does not occur, the ACTH level will be low in the presence of a cortisol-producing adrenal tumor and elevated in patients with an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor. B. Corticosteroids and Stimulation of Lung Maturation in the Fetus\n\n\n\nLung maturation in the fetus is regulated by the fetal secretion of cortisol. Treatment of the mother with large doses of glucocorticoid reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in infants delivered prematurely. When delivery is anticipated before 34 weeks of gestation, intramuscular betamethasone, 12 mg, followed by an additional dose of 12 mg 18–24 hours later, is commonly used. Betamethasone is chosen because maternal protein binding and placental metabolism of this corticosteroid is less than that of cortisol, allowing increased transfer across the placenta to the fetus. A study of more than 10,000 infants born at 23–25 weeks of gestation indicated that exposure to exogenous corticosteroids before birth reduced the death rate and evidence of neurodevelopmental impairment. C. Corticosteroids and Nonadrenal Disorders\n\n\n\nThe synthetic analogs of cortisol are useful in the treatment of a diverse group of diseases unrelated to any known disturbance of adrenal function (Table 39–2). The usefulness of corticosteroids in these disorders is a function of their ability to suppress inflammatory and immune responses and to alter leukocyte function, as previously described (see also Chapter 55). These agents are useful in disorders in which host response is the cause of the major manifestations of the disease. In instances in which the inflammatory or immune response is important in controlling the pathologic process, therapy with corticosteroids may be dangerous but justified to prevent irreparable damage from an inflammatory response—if used in conjunction with specific therapy for the disease process. Since corticosteroids are not usually curative, the pathologic process may progress while clinical manifestations are suppressed. Therefore, chronic therapy with these drugs should be undertaken with great care and only when the seriousness of the disorder warrants their use and when less hazardous measures have been exhausted. In general, attempts should be made to bring the disease process under control using mediumto intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone and prednisolone (Table 39–1), as well as all ancillary measures possible to keep the dose low. Where possible, alternate-day therapy should be used (see the following text).']","['1', '""PCOS Irregular menses, slow-onset hirsutism, obesity, infertility, hypertension, a family history of PCOS or DM.""\n2', '""Cushing’s syndrome Hypertension, buffalo hump, purple striae, truncal obesity.""\n3', '""High BP', 'BMI > 30 (obesity)', 'Stigmata of hyperandrogenism or insulin resistance (menstrual cycle disturbances, hirsutism, obesity, acne, androgenic alopecia, acanthosis nigricans).""\n4', '""Biochemical hyperandrogenemia: ↑ testosterone (total +/− free); DHEAS, DHEA.""\n5', '""These increased levels may result in hypertension with or without hypokalemic alkalosis and hyperandrogenism expressed as virilization and precocious puberty in children and acne, hirsutism, male pattern baldness, and menstrual irregularities (mostly oligo-amenorrhea and hypofertility) in women.""']",0.10126582278481013,"[""Normal PRL Normal FSH Normal estrogen Low estrogen Neurological exam.

New York: Intercontinental Medical Book  corporation, 1971.)\n\n\n\nIf a pathogen is too large to be successfully phagocytosed (if it is a large parasite such as a worm, for example), a group of macrophages, neutrophils, or eosinophils (another type of leukocyte) will gather around the invader. They secrete defensins and other damaging agents and release the toxic products of the respiratory burst. This barrage is often sufficient to destroy the pathogen (Figure 24–6). The blood and other extracellular fluids contain numerous proteins with antimicrobial activity, some of which are produced in response to an infection, while others are produced constitutively. The most important of these are components of the complement system, which consists of about thirty interacting soluble proteins that are mainly made continuously by the liver and are inactive until an infection or another trigger activates them. They were originally identified by their ability to amplify and “complement” the action of antibodies made by B cells, but some are also secreted PRRs, which directly recognize PAMPs on microbes. The early complement components consist of three sets of proteins, belonging to three distinct pathways of complement activation—the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. The early components of all three pathways act locally to cleave and activate C3, which is the pivotal complement component (Figure 24–7); individuals with a C3 deficiency are subject to repeated bacterial infections. The early components are proenzymes, which are activated sequentially by proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage of each proenzyme in the series activates the next component to generate a serine protease, which cleaves the next proenzyme in the series, and so on. Since each activated enzyme cleaves many molecules of the next proenzyme in the chain, the activation of the early components consists of an amplifying proteolytic cascade. Many of these protein cleavages liberate a biologically active small fragment that can attract neutrophils, plus a membrane-binding larger fragment. The binding of the large fragment to a cell membrane, usually the surface of a pathogen, helps stimulate the next reaction in the sequence. In this way, complement activation is largely kept confined to the cell surface where it began. In particular, the large fragment of C3, called C3b, binds covalently to the surface of the pathogen. Here, it recruits protein fragments produced by cleavage of other early complement components to form proteolytic complexes that catalyze the subsequent steps in the complement cascade. The early events in complement activation have diverse functions: C3b-binding receptors on phagocytic cells enhance the ability of these cells to phagocytose the pathogen, and similar receptors on B cells enhance the\n\n\n\nFigure 24–6 eosinophils attacking a parasite. phagocytes cannot ingest large parasites such as the schistosome larva shown here. When the larva is coated with antibody or complement components, however, eosinophils (and other leukocytes) can recognize it and collectively kill it by secreting a large variety of toxic molecules. (courtesy of Anthony Butterworth.)\n\n\n\nFigure 24–7 The principal stages in complement activation by the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. In all three pathways, the reactions of complement activation usually take place on the surface of an invading microbe, such as a bacterium, and lead to the cleavage of c3 and the various consequences shown. As indicated, the complement proteins c1 to c9, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), MBL-associated serine protease (MASp), and factors B and D are the central components of the complement system. The early components are shown within gray arrows, while the late components are shown within a brown arrow. The functions of the protein fragments produced during complement activation are indicated by the black arrows. The various complement proteins that regulate the system are omitted. ability of these cells to make antibodies against various microbial molecules on C3b-coated pathogens; the smaller fragment of C3 (called C3a), as well as small fragments of C4 and C5, act independently as diffusible signals to promote an inflammatory response by recruiting leukocytes to the site of infection. As indicated in Figure 24–7, antibodies bound to the surface of a pathogen activate the classical pathway. Mannose‑binding lectin, mentioned earlier, is a secreted PRR that initiates the lectin pathway of complement activation when it recognizes bacterial or fungal glycolipids and glycoproteins bearing terminal mannose and fucose sugars in a particular spatial conformation. These initial binding events in the classical and lectin pathways cause the recruitment and activation of the early complement components. Finally, molecules on the surface of pathogens will often directly activate the alternative pathway. Host cells produce various plasma membrane molecules that prevent complement reactions from proceeding on their cell surface. The most important of these is the carbohydrate moiety sialic acid, a common constituent of cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids (see Figure 10–16). Because pathogens generally lack sialic acid, they are singled out for complement-mediated destruction, while host cells are spared. Some pathogens, including the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae that causes the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, coat themselves with a layer of sialic acid to effectively hide from the complement system. Membrane-immobilized C3b, produced by any of the three pathways, triggers a further cascade of reactions that leads to the assembly of the late complement components to form membrane attack complexes. These protein complexes assemble in the pathogen membrane near the site of C3 activation, forming aqueous pores through the membrane (Figure 24–8). For this reason, and because they perturb the structure of the lipid bilayer in their vicinity, they make the membrane leaky and can, in some cases, cause the microbe to lyse. The self-amplifying, inflammatory, and destructive properties of the complement cascade make it essential that key activated components be rapidly inactivated after they are generated, ensuring that the attack does not spread to nearby host cells. Inactivation is achieved in at least two ways. First, specific inhibitor proteins in the blood or on the surface of host cells terminate the cascade, by either binding or cleaving certain complement components once the components have been activated by proteolytic cleavage. Second, many of the activated components in the cascade are unstable; unless they bind immediately to either the next component in the complement cascade or to a nearby membrane, they rapidly inactivate. Virus-Infected cells Take Drastic Measures to prevent Viral replication\n\n\n\nBecause host-cell ribosomes make a virus’s proteins and host-cell lipids form the membranes of enveloped viruses, PAMPs are generally not present on the surface of viruses. Therefore, the only general way that a host cell PRR can recognize the presence of a virus is to detect unusual elements of the viral genome, such as the\n\n\n\nFigure 24–8 Assembly of the late complement components to form a membrane attack complex. The cleavage of the early complement components (shown within gray arrows in Figure 24–7) results in the formation of c3bcontaining proteolytic complexes called c5 convertases (not shown). These then cleave the first of the late components, c5, to produce c5a and c5b. As illustrated, c5b rapidly assembles with c6 and c7 to form c567, which then binds firmly via c7 to the membrane. One molecule of c8 binds to the complex to form c5678. The binding of a molecule of c9 to c5678 induces a conformational change in c9 that exposes a hydrophobic region and causes c9 to insert into the lipid bilayer of the target membrane. This starts a chain reaction in which the altered c9 binds a second molecule of c9, which can then bind another molecule of c9, and so on. In this way, a ring of c9 molecules forms a large transmembrane channel in the membrane. double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is an intermediate in the life cycle of many viruses and is recognized by several PRRs including the Toll-like receptor TLR3; in addition, DNA virus genomes frequently contain significant amounts of the CpG motifs discussed earlier, which can be recognized by TLR9 (see Table 24–1, p. 1300). Mammalian cells are particularly adept at recognizing the presence of dsRNA, which activates intracellular PRRs that induce the host cell to produce and secrete two antiviral cytokines—interferon-α (IFNα) and interferon-β (IFNβ). These interferons are referred to as type I interferons to distinguish them from IFNγ, which is a type II interferon and has different functions, as we discuss later. Type I interferons act in both an autocrine fashion on the infected cells that produced it and a paracrine fashion on uninfected neighbors. They bind to a common cell-surface receptor, which activates the JAK–STAT intracellular signaling pathway (see Figure 15–56) to stimulate specific gene transcription and thereby the production of more than 300 proteins, including many cytokines, reflecting the complexity of the cell’s acute response to a viral infection. The production of type I interferons appears to be a general response of mammalian cells to a viral infection, and viral components other than dsRNA can trigger it. The type I interferons help block viral replication in multiple ways. They activate a latent ribonuclease that nonspecifically degrades single-stranded RNA. They also indirectly activate a protein kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2 (discussed in Chapter 6), thereby shutting down most protein synthesis in the infected host cell. Apparently, by destroying most of its own RNA and transiently halting most of its protein synthesis, the host cell inhibits viral replication without killing itself. If these measures fail, the cell takes an even more extreme step to prevent the virus from replicating: it kills itself by undergoing apoptosis, often with the help of immune killer cells, as we discuss next. Natural Killer cells Induce Virus-Infected cells to Kill Themselves\n\n\n\nType I interferons also have less direct ways of blocking viral replication. One of these is to enhance the activity of natural killer cells (NK cells), which are leukocytes related to T and B cells but are part of the innate immune system and are recruited early to sites of inflammation. Like cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune system (discussed later), NK cells destroy virus-infected cells by inducing the infected cells to kill themselves by undergoing apoptosis (discussed in Chapter 18). We consider how killer cells induce apoptosis later, when we discuss how cytotoxic T cells do it (see Figure 24–43). Although they kill in the same way, the means by which cytotoxic T cells and NK cells distinguish the surface of virus-infected cells from that of uninfected cells are different (Movie 24.2). Both cytotoxic T cells and NK cells recognize the same special class of cell-surface proteins on a host cell to help determine if the cell is virus-infected, but they use distinct receptors to do so. The special cell-surface proteins recognized are called class I MHC proteins, because they are encoded by genes in the major histocompatibility complex; almost all nucleated cells in vertebrates express these genes, and we discuss them in detail later. Cytotoxic T cells use both T cell receptors (TCRs) and co‑receptors to recognize peptide fragments of viral proteins bound to class I MHC proteins on the surface of virus-infected host cells and then induce the infected cells to kill themselves. By contrast, NK cells have cell-surface inhibitory receptors that monitor the level of class I MHC proteins on the surface of other host cells: the high levels of these MHC proteins normally present on healthy cells engage these receptors and thereby inhibit the killing activity of the NK cells. The NK cells thus focus primarily on host cells expressing abnormally low levels of class I MHC proteins and induce them to kill themselves; these are mainly virus-infected cells and some cancer cells (Figure 24–9). NK cell killing activity is stimulated when various activating receptors on the NK cell surface recognize specific proteins that are greatly increased on the surface of virus-infected cells and some cancer cells.

This scanning electron micrograph was taken shortly after the NK cell attached to the cancer cell, but before it induced the cell to die by apoptosis.

Renal function is initially unchanged, but blood urea nitrogen and creatinine rise progressively. Hepatic transaminases may be markedly elevated due to liver hypoperfusion. The lactic acid level is elevated. Arterial blood gases usually demonstrate hypoxemia and anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may be compensated by respiratory alkalosis. Cardiac markers, creatine phosphokinase and its MB fraction, and troponins I and T are typically markedly elevated. electrocardiogram In CS due to acute MI with LV failure, Q waves and/or >2-mm ST elevation in multiple leads or left bundle branch block are usually present. More than one-half of all infarcts associated with shock are anterior. Global ischemia due to severe left main stenosis usually is accompanied by severe (e.g., >3 mm) ST depressions in multiple leads. chest roentgenogram The chest x-ray typically shows pulmonary vascular congestion and often pulmonary edema, but these findings may be absent in up to a third of patients. The heart size is usually normal when CS results from a first MI but is enlarged when it occurs in a patient with a previous MI. echocardiogram A two-dimensional echocardiogram with color-flow Doppler (Chap. 270e) should be obtained promptly in patients with suspected CS to help define its etiology.

"A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. She has no personal history of serious illness. Medications include iron supplements and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. A 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge shows a glucose concentration of 155 mg/dL (N < 135 mg/dL). A 100-g oral glucose tolerance test shows glucose concentrations of 205 mg/dL (N < 180 mg/dL) and 154 mg/dL (N <140 mg/dL) at 1 and 3 hours, respectively. She refuses treatment with insulin.

D:Hypermagnesemia
E:Hyperglycemia
","['Also, the likelihood of restricted growth increases with worsening White classification, particularly nephropathy (Klemetti, 2016). hat said, the prevalence of serious vascular disease associated with diabetes in pregnancy is low, and the primary efect of overt diabetes, especially type 1, is fetal overrowth. For example, in a prospective study of 682 consecutive pregnancies complicated by diabetes, women with type 1 diabetes were significantly more likely than women with type 2 diabetes to have a neonate weighing above the 90th and 97.7th percentiles (Murphy, 2011). Additionally, women with type 1 diabetes were significantly less likely to deliver an SGA newborn. In a recent study of 375 term singleton pregnancies complicated by type 1 diabetes, the risk of fetal overgrowth correlated with rising third-trimester glycemic values (C yganek, 2017) . Nearly a fourth of neonates were macrosomic. And, third-trimester hemoglobin Al c and fasting glucose values were independent predictors for the risk of macrosomia. Conditions associated with chronic uteroplacental hypoxia include preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, asthma, maternal cyanotic heart disease, smoking, and high altitude. When exposed to a chronically hypoxic environment, some fetuses have signiicantly reduced birthweight. In more than 1.8 million births in Austria, the birthweight declined 150 g for each 1000meter rise in altitude (Waldhoer, 2015). In 63,620 Peruvian live births, the mean birthweight was significantly decreased at higher compared with lower altitudes-3065 g ± 475 g versus 3280 g ± 525 g (Gonzales, 2009). In this study, the rate of birth weights <2500 g was 6.2 percent at low altitudes, and it was 9.2 percent at high altitudes. In contrast, the rate of birthweights >4000 g was 6.3 percent at low altitudes and 1.6 percent at high altitudes. In most cases, maternal anemia does not restrict fetal growth. Exceptions include sickle-cell disease and some other inherited anemias (Desai, 2017; Thame, 2016). Importantly, curtailed maternal blood-volume expansion is linked to fetal-growth restriction (de Haas, 2017; Stott, 2017). This is further discussed in Chapter 40 (p.', 'T AB LE 2.1 1 -1 2.

Fetus: 18–20 weeks: Ultrasound to determine fetal age and growth; evaluate for cardiac anomalies and polyhydramnios; quad screen to screen for developmental anomalies. 32–34 weeks: Close fetal surveillance (e.g., NST, CST, BPP). Admit if maternal DM has been poorly controlled or fetal parameters are a concern. Serial ultrasounds for fetal growth. Delivery and postpartum:\n\n\n\nMaintain normoglycemia (80–100 mg/dL) during labor with an IV insulin drip and hourly glucose measurements. Consider early delivery in the setting of poor maternal glucose control, preeclampsia, macrosomia, or evidence of fetal lung maturity. Cesarean delivery should be considered for an estimated fetal weight (EFW) > 4500 g. Greater than eight, investigate! If HbA1c is > 8%, look for congenital abnormalities. If UA before 20 weeks reveals glycosuria, think pregestational diabetes. Hyperglycemia in the f rst trimester suggests preexisting diabetes and should be managed as pregestational diabetes.

","['The prognosis is guarded. Lupus nephritis is a common and serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and most severe in African-American female adolescents. Thirty to 50% of patients will have clinical manifestations of renal disease at the time of diagnosis, and 60% of adults and 80% of children develop renal abnormalities at some point in the course of their disease. Lupus nephritis results from the deposition of circulating immune complexes, which activate the complement cascade leading to complement-mediated damage, leukocyte infiltration, activation of procoagulant factors, and release of various cytokines. In situ immune complex formation following glomerular binding of nuclear antigens, particularly necrotic nucleosomes, also plays a role in renal injury. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies may also trigger a thrombotic microangiopathy in a minority of patients. The clinical manifestations, course of disease, and treatment of lupus nephritis are closely linked to renal pathology. The most common clinical sign of renal disease is proteinuria, but hematuria, hypertension, varying degrees of renal failure, and active urine sediment with red blood cell casts can all be present. Although significant renal pathology can be found on biopsy even in the absence of major abnormalities in the urinalysis, most nephrologists do not biopsy patients until the urinalysis is convincingly abnormal. The extrarenal manifestations of lupus are important in establishing a firm diagnosis of systemic lupus because, while serologic abnormalities are common in lupus nephritis, they are not diagnostic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies that fix complement correlate best with the presence of renal disease. Hypocomplementemia is common in patients with acute lupus nephritis (70–90%) and declining complement levels may herald a flare. Although urinary biomarkers of lupus nephritis are being identified to assist in predicting renal flares, renal biopsy is the only reliable method of identifying the morphologic variants of lupus nephritis. The World Health Organization (WHO) workshop in 1974 first outlined several distinct patterns of lupus-related glomerular injury; these were modified in 1982. In 2004 the International Society of Nephrology in conjunction with the Renal Pathology Society again updated the classification. This latest version of lesions seen on biopsy (Table 338-3) best defines clinicopathologic correlations, provides valuable prognostic information, and forms the basis for modern treatment recommendations. Class I nephritis describes normal glomerular histology by any technique or normal light microscopy with minimal mesangial deposits on immunofluorescent or electron microscopy. Class II designates mesangial immune complexes with mesangial proliferation. Both class I and II lesions are typically associated with minimal renal manifestation and normal renal function; nephrotic syndrome is rare. Patients with lesions limited to the renal mesangium have an excellent prognosis and generally do not need therapy for their lupus nephritis. The subject of lupus nephritis is presented under acute nephritic syndromes because of the aggressive and important proliferative lesions seen in class III–V renal disease. Class III describes focal lesions\n\n\n\nNote: Revised in 2004 by the International Society of Nephrology-Renal Pathology Society Study Group.', 'Associated with HBV, syphilis, malaria, and gold. “Spike-and-dome” appearance due to granular deposits of IgG and C3 at the basement membrane.

Tight control of blood sugar; ACEIs for type 1 DM and ARBs for type 2 DM. TAB LE 2.1 6-7. Causes of Nephrotic Syndrome (continued)\n\n\n\nLupus nephritis Classifed as WHO types I–VI. Both nephrotic and nephritic. The severity of renal disease often determines overall prognosis. Proteinuria or RBCs on UA may be found during evaluation of SLE patients. Mesangial proliferation; subendothelial and/or subepithelial immune complex deposition. Prednisone and cytotoxic therapy may slow disease progression. Renal amyloidosis 1° (plasma cell dyscrasia) and 2° (infectious or infammatory) are the most common. Patients may have multiple myeloma or a chronic inf ammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, TB). Nodular glomerulosclerosis; EM reveals amyloid f brils; apple-green birefringence with Congo red stain. Prednisone and melphalan. Bone marrow transplant may be used for multiple myeloma. Membrano-proliferative nephropathy Can also be nephritic syndrome. Type I is associated with HCV, cryoglobulinemia, SLE, and subacute bacterial endocarditis. Idiopathic form is present at 8–30 years of age. Slow progression to renal failure. “Tram-track,” double-layered basement membrane. Type I has subendothelial deposits and mesangial deposits; all three types have low serum C3; type II by way of C3 nephritic factor. Corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents may help. Proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, hyperlipidemia, and hyperlipiduria in nephrotic syndrome are due to the initial ↑ in permeability of the glomerulus to protein. Presents with generalized edema and foamy urine. In severe cases, dyspnea and ascites may develop. Patients have ↑ susceptibility to infection as well as a predisposition to hypercoagulable states with an ↑ risk for venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. UA shows proteinuria (≥ 3.5 g/day) and lipiduria. Blood chemistry shows ↓ albumin (< 3 g/dL) and hyperlipidemia. Evaluation should include workup for 2° causes. Renal biopsy is used to definitively diagnose the underlying etiology. ■ Treat with protein and salt restriction, judicious diuretic therapy, and antihyperlipidemics. Immunosuppressant medications may be useful for certain etiologies. ACEIs ↓ proteinuria and diminish the progression of renal disease in patients with renal scarring. Vaccinate with 23-polyvalent pneumococcus vaccine (PPV23), as patients are at ↑ risk of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Renal calculi. Stones are most commonly calcium oxalate but may also be calcium phosphate, struvite, uric acid, or cystine (see Table 2.16-8 and Figure 2.16-4). Risk factors include a  family history, low f uid intake, gout, medications (allopurinol, chemotherapy, loop diuretics), postcolectomy/ postileostomy, specific enzyme deficiencies, type I RTA (due to alkaline urinary pH and associated hypocitruria), and hyperparathyroidism. Most common in older males. Presents with acute onset of severe, colicky f ank pain that may radiate to the testes or vulva and is associated with nausea and vomiting. Patients are unable to get comfortable and shift position frequently (as opposed to those with peritonitis, who lie still). UA may show gross or microscopic hematuria (85%) and an altered urine pH.

New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004: 243.)\n\n\n\nNoncontrast abdominal CT scans are the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney stones. Consider a renal ultrasound to look for obstruction (ultrasound is also preferred for pregnant patients, in whom radiation from CT should be avoided). An IVP can be used to confirm the diagnosis if there is a lack of contrast filling below the stone. Hydration and analgesia are the initial treatment. Kidney stones < 5 mm in diameter can pass through the urethra; stones < 3 cm in diameter can be treated with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or retrograde ureteroscopy. Preventive measures include hydration; additional prophylaxis is dependent on stone composition. Characterized by the presence of progressive cystic dilation of the renal tubules, as well as by cysts in the spleen, liver, and pancreas. The two major forms are as follows: ■Autosomal dominant (ADPKD):\n\n\n\nMost common. Usually asymptomatic until patients are > 30 years of age. One-half of ADPKD patients will have ESRD requiring dialysis by age 60. Associated with an ↑ risk of cerebral aneurysm, especially in patients with a  family history. Autosomal recessive (ARPKD): Less common but more severe. Presents in infants and young children with renal failure, liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension; may lead to death in the first few years of life. Pain and hematuria are the most common presenting symptoms. Sharp, localized pain may result from cyst rupture, infection, or passage of renal calculi. Additional findings include hypertension, hepatic cysts, cerebral berry aneurysms, diverticulosis, and mitral valve prolapse. Patients may have large, palpable kidneys on abdominal exam. Based on ultrasound (most common) or CT scan. Multiple bilateral cysts will be present throughout the renal parenchyma, and renal enlargement will be visualized. Genetic testing by DNA linkage analysis for ADPKD1 and ADPKD2 is available. Prevent complications and ↓ the rate of progression to ESRD. Early management of UTIs is critical to prevent renal cyst infection. BP control (ACEIs, ARBs) is necessary to ↓ hypertension-induced renal damage. Dialysis and renal transplantation are used to manage patients with ESRD.

Thus, many premenopausal women have low iron stores or even iron deficiency. In men and postmenopausal women, the most common site of blood loss is the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with unexplained iron deficiency anemia should be evaluated for occult gastrointestinal bleeding. B. Treatment\n\n\n\nIron deficiency anemia is treated with oral or parenteral iron preparations. Oral iron corrects the anemia just as rapidly and completely as parenteral iron in most cases if iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is normal. An exception is the high requirement for iron of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease who are undergoing hemodialysis and treatment with erythropoietin; for these patients, parenteral iron administration is preferred. 1. Oral iron therapy—A wide variety of oral iron preparations is available. Because ferrous iron is most efficiently absorbed, ferrous salts should be used. Ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate are all effective and inexpensive and are recommended for the treatment of most patients. Different iron salts provide different amounts of elemental iron, as shown in Table 33–3. In an iron-deficient individual, about 50–100 mg of iron can be incorporated into hemoglobin daily, and about 25% of oral iron given as ferrous salt can be absorbed. Therefore, 200–400 mg of elemental iron should be given daily to correct iron deficiency most rapidly. Patients unable to tolerate such large doses of iron can be given lower daily doses of iron, which results in slower but still complete correction of iron deficiency. Treatment with oral iron should be continued for 3–6 months after correction of the cause of the iron loss. This corrects the anemia and replenishes iron stores. Common adverse effects of oral iron therapy include nausea, epigastric discomfort, abdominal cramps, constipation, and diarrhea. These effects are usually dose-related and often can be overcome by lowering the daily dose of iron or by taking the tablets immediately after or with meals. Some patients have less severe\n\n\n\nTABLE 33–3 Some commonly used oral iron preparations. gastrointestinal adverse effects with one iron salt than another and benefit from changing preparations. Patients taking oral iron develop black stools; this has no clinical significance in itself but may obscure the diagnosis of continued gastrointestinal blood loss. 2. Parenteral iron therapy—Parenteral therapy should be reserved for patients with documented iron deficiency who are unable to tolerate or absorb oral iron and for patients with extensive chronic anemia who cannot be maintained with oral iron alone. This includes patients with advanced chronic renal disease requiring hemodialysis and treatment with erythropoietin, various postgastrectomy conditions and previous small bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease involving the proximal small bowel, and malabsorption syndromes. The challenge with parenteral iron therapy is that parenteral administration of inorganic free ferric iron produces serious dose-dependent toxicity, which severely limits the dose that can be administered. However, when the ferric iron is formulated as a colloid containing particles with a core of iron oxyhydroxide surrounded by a core of carbohydrate, bioactive iron is released slowly from the stable colloid particles. In the United States, the three traditional forms of parenteral iron are iron dextran, sodium ferric gluconate complex, and iron sucrose. Two newer preparations are available (see below). Iron dextran is a stable complex of ferric oxyhydroxide and dextran polymers containing 50 mg of elemental iron per milliliter of solution. It can be given by deep intramuscular injection or by intravenous infusion, although the intravenous route is used most commonly. Intravenous administration eliminates the local pain and tissue staining that often occur with the intramuscular route and allows delivery of the entire dose of iron necessary to correct the iron deficiency at one time. Adverse effects of intravenous iron dextran therapy include headache, light-headedness, fever, arthralgias, nausea and vomiting, back pain, flushing, urticaria, bronchospasm, and, rarely, anaphylaxis and death. Owing to the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction, a small test dose of iron dextran should always be given before full intramuscular or intravenous doses are given. Patients with a strong history of allergy and patients who have previously received parenteral iron dextran are more likely to have hypersensitivity reactions after treatment with parenteral iron dextran. The iron dextran formulations used clinically are distinguishable as high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight forms. In the United States, the INFeD preparation is a low-molecular-weight form while Dexferrum is a high-molecular-weight form. Clinical data—primarily from observational studies—indicate that the risk of anaphylaxis is largely associated with high-molecular-weight formulations. Sodium ferric gluconate complex and iron-sucrose complex are alternative parenteral iron preparations. Ferric carboxymaltose is a colloidal iron preparation embedded within a carbohydrate polymer. Ferumoxytol is a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle coated with carbohydrate. The carbohydrate shell is removed in the reticuloendothelial system, allowing the iron to be stored as ferritin, or released to transferrin. Ferumoxytol may interfere with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Thus if imaging is needed, MRI should be performed prior to ferumoxytol therapy or alternative imaging modality used if needed soon after dosing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black box warning about risk of potentially fatal allergic reactions associated with the use of ferumoxytol. For patients treated chronically with parenteral iron, it is important to monitor iron storage levels to avoid the serious toxicity associated with iron overload. Unlike oral iron therapy, which is subject to the regulatory mechanism provided by the intestinal uptake system, parenteral administration—which bypasses this regulatory system—can deliver more iron than can be safely stored. Iron stores can be estimated on the basis of serum concentrations of ferritin and the transferrin saturation, which is the ratio of the total serum iron concentration to the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). A. Acute Iron Toxicity\n\n\n\nAcute iron toxicity is seen almost exclusively in young children who accidentally ingest iron tablets. As few as 10 tablets of any of the commonly available oral iron preparations can be lethal in young children. Adult patients taking oral iron preparations should be instructed to store tablets in child-proof containers out of the reach of children. Children who are poisoned with oral iron experience necrotizing gastroenteritis with vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea followed by shock, lethargy, and dyspnea. Subsequently, improvement is often noted, but this may be followed by severe metabolic acidosis, coma, and death.', 'Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis early. Treatment before permanent organ damage occurs can reverse the iron toxicity and restore life expectancy to normal. The history should be particularly detailed in regard to disease in other family members; alcohol ingestion; iron intake; and ingestion of large doses of ascorbic acid, which promotes iron absorption (Chap. 96e). Appropriate tests should be performed to exclude iron deposition due to hematologic disease. The presence of liver, pancreatic, cardiac, and joint disease should be confirmed by physical examination, radiography, and standard function tests of these organs. The degree of increase in total body iron stores can be assessed by (1) measurement of serum iron and the percent saturation of transferrin (or the unsaturated iron-binding capacity), (2) measurement of serum ferritin concentration, (3) liver biopsy with measurement of the iron concentration and calculation of the hepatic iron index (Table 428-2), and (4) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver. In addition, a retrospective assessment of body-iron storage is also provided by performing weekly phlebotomy and calculating the amount of iron removed before iron stores are exhausted (1 mL blood = approximately 0.5 mg iron). Each of these methods for assessing iron stores has advantages and limitations. The serum iron level and percent saturation of transferrin are elevated early in the course, but their specificity is reduced by significant false-positive and false-negative rates. For example, serum iron concentration may be increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease without iron overload; in this situation, however, the hepatic 2517 iron index is usually not increased as in hemochromatosis (Table 428-1). In otherwise healthy persons, a fasting serum transferrin saturation greater than 45% is abnormal and suggests homozygosity for hemochromatosis. The serum ferritin concentration is usually a good index of body-iron stores, whether decreased or increased. In fact, an increase of 1 μg/L in serum ferritin level reflects an increase of about 5 mg in body stores. In most untreated patients with hemochromatosis, the serum ferritin level is significantly increased (Fig. 428-2 and Table 428-1), and a serum ferritin level >1000 μg/L is the strongest predictor of disease expression among individuals homozygous for the C282Y mutation. However, in patients with inflammation and hepatocellular necrosis, serum ferritin levels may be elevated out of proportion to body-iron stores due to increased release from tissues. Therefore, a repeat determination of serum ferritin should be carried out after acute hepatocellular damage has subsided (e.g., in alcoholic liver disease). Ordinarily, the combined measurements of the percent transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level provide a simple and reliable screening test for hemochromatosis, including the precirrhotic phase of the disease. If either of these tests is abnormal, genetic testing for hemochromatosis should be performed (Fig. 428-3). The role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis has been reassessed as a result of the widespread availability of genetic testing for the C282Y mutation. The absence of severe fibrosis can be accurately predicted in most patients using clinical and biochemical variables. Thus, there is virtually no risk of severe fibrosis in a C282Y homozygous subject with (1) serum ferritin level less than 1000 μg/L, (2) normal serum alanine aminotransferase values, (3) no hepatomegaly, and (4) no excess alcohol intake. However, it should be emphasized that liver biopsy is the only reliable method for establishing or excluding the presence of hepatic cirrhosis, which is the critical factor determining prognosis and the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Biopsy also permits histochemical estimation of tissue iron and measurement of hepatic iron concentration. Increased density of the liver due to iron deposition can be demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) or MRI, and with improved technology, MRI has become more accurate in determining hepatic iron concentration. When the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is established, it is important to counsel and screen other family members (Chap. 84). Asymptomatic and symptomatic family members with the disease usually have an increased saturation of transferrin and an increased serum ferritin concentration. These changes occur even before the iron stores are greatly increased (Fig. 428-2). All adult first-degree relatives of patients with hemochromatosis should be tested for the C282Y and H63D mutations and counseled appropriately (Fig. 428-3). In affected individuals, it is important to confirm or exclude the presence of cirrhosis and begin therapy as early as possible. For children of an identified proband, testing for HFE of the other parent is helpful because if\n\n\n\nTAblE 428-2 REPRESEnTATivE iRon vAluES in noRmAl SubJECTS, PATiEnTS wiTH HEmoCHRomAToSiS, AnD PATiEnTS wiTH AlCoHoliC livER DiSEASE\n\n\n\nAdult first-degree relative of patient with HH Subjects with unexplained liver disease Individual with suggestive symptoms (see text) Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin* TS <45% SF <300 TS ˜45% and/or SF >300 °gL Reassure, possibly retest later HFE Genotype PhlebotomyNormal Counsel and consider non-HFE hemochromatosis Serum ferritin – 300–1000 °g/L LFT normal Serum ferritin > 1000 °g/L and/or LFT abnormal Serum ferritin <300 °g/L LFT normal Observe retest in 1–2 years C282Y Homozygote C282Y/H63D (Compound Heterozygote) Confirmed iron overload *For convenience both genotype and phenotype (iron tests) can be performed together at a single visit in first-degree relatives.

Otherwise, for practical purposes, children need not be checked before they are 18 years old. The role of population screening for hemochromatosis is controversial. Recent studies indicate that it is highly effective for primary care physicians to screen subjects using transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels. Such screening also detects iron deficiency. Genetic screening of the normal population is feasible but is probably not cost effective. The therapy of hemochromatosis involves removal of the excess body iron and supportive treatment of damaged organs. Iron removal is best accomplished by weekly or twice-weekly phlebotomy of 500 mL. Although there is an initial modest decline in the volume of packed red blood cells to about 35 mL/dL, the level stabilizes after several weeks. The plasma transferrin saturation remains increased until the available iron stores are depleted. In contrast, the plasma ferritin concentration falls progressively, reflecting the gradual decrease in body-iron stores. One 500-mL unit of blood contains 200–250 mg of iron, and up to 25 g of iron or more may have to be removed. Therefore, in patients with advanced disease, weekly phlebotomy may be required for 1–2 years, and it should be continued until the serum ferritin level is <50 μg/L. Thereafter, phlebotomies are performed at appropriate intervals to maintain ferritin levels between 50 and 100 μg/L. Usually one phlebotomy every 3 months will suffice. Chelating agents such as deferoxamine, when given parenterally, remove 10–20 mg of iron per day, which is much less than that mobilized by once-weekly phlebotomy. Phlebotomy is also less expensive, more convenient, and safer for most patients. However, chelating agents are indicated when anemia or hypoproteinemia is severe enough to preclude phlebotomy. Subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine using a portable pump is the most effective means of its administration. An effective oral iron chelating agent, deferasirox (Exjade), has recently become available but is still in clinical trials. This agent is effective in thalassemia and secondary iron overload, but its role in primary iron overload has yet to be established. Alcohol consumption should be severely curtailed or eliminated because it increases the risk of cirrhosis in hereditary hemochromatosis nearly tenfold. Dietary adjustments are unnecessary, although vitamin C and iron supplements should be avoided. The management of hepatic failure, cardiac failure, and diabetes mellitus is similar to conventional therapy for these conditions. Loss of libido and change in secondary sex characteristics are managed with testosterone replacement or gonadotropin therapy (Chap. 411). End-stage liver disease may be an indication for liver transplantation, although results are improved if the excess iron can be removed beforehand. The available evidence indicates that the fundamental metabolic abnormality in hemochromatosis is reversed by successful liver transplantation. The principal causes of death are cardiac failure, hepatocellular failure or portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Life expectancy is improved by removal of the excessive stores of iron and maintenance of these stores at near-normal levels. The 5-year survival rate with therapy increases from 33 to 89%. With repeated phlebotomy, the liver decreases in size, liver function improves, pigmentation of skin decreases, and cardiac failure may be reversed. Diabetes improves in about 40% of patients, but removal of excess iron has little effect on hypogonadism or arthropathy. Hepatic fibrosis may decrease, but established cirrhosis is irreversible. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs as a late sequela in patients who are cirrhotic at presentation. The apparent increase in its incidence in treated patients is probably related to their increased life span. Hepatocellular carcinoma rarely develops if the disease is treated in the precirrhotic stage. Indeed, the life expectancy of homozygotes treated before the development of cirrhosis is normal. The importance of family screening and early diagnosis and treatment cannot be overemphasized. Asymptomatic individuals detected by family studies should have phlebotomy therapy if iron stores are moderately to severely increased. Assessment of iron stores at appropriate intervals is also important. With this management approach, most manifestations of the disease can be prevented. There is considerable interest in the role of HFE mutations and hepatic iron in several other liver diseases. Several studies have shown an increased prevalence of HFE mutations in PCT patients. Iron accentuates the inherited enzyme deficiency in PCT and clinical manifestations of PCT. The situation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is less clear, but some studies have shown an increased prevalence of HFE mutations in NASH patients. The role of phlebotomy therapy, however, is unproven. In chronic HCV infection, HFE mutations are not more common, but some subjects have increased hepatic iron. Before initiating antiviral therapy in these patients, it is reasonable to perform phlebotomy therapy to remove excess iron stores, because this reduces liver enzyme levels. HFE mutations are not increased in frequency in alcoholic liver disease. Hemochromatosis in a heavy drinker can be distinguished from alcoholic liver disease by the presence of the C282Y mutation. End-stage liver disease may also be associated with iron overload of the degree seen in hemochromatosis. The mechanism is uncertain, although studies have shown that alcohol suppresses hepatic hepcidin secretion. Hemolysis also plays a role.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['The severity and cause of iron-deficiency anemia will determine the appropriate approach to treatment. As an example, symptomatic elderly patients with severe iron-deficiency anemia and cardiovascular instability may require red cell transfusions. Younger individuals who have compensated for their anemia can be treated more conservatively with iron replacement. The foremost issue for the latter patient is the precise identification of the cause of the iron deficiency.\n\n\n\nFor the majority of cases of iron deficiency (pregnant women, growing children and adolescents, patients with infrequent episodes of bleeding, and those with inadequate dietary intake of iron), oral iron therapy will suffice. For patients with unusual blood loss or malabsorption, specific diagnostic tests and appropriate therapy take priority. Once the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia and its cause is made, there are three major therapeutic approaches.', 'The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is established by the presence of a microcytic hypochromic anemia, low serum ferritin levels, low serum iron levels, reduced transferrin saturation, normal to elevated red blood cell width distribution, and enhanced iron-binding capacity. The mean corpuscular volume and red blood cell indices are reduced, and the reticulocyte count is low. Iron deficiency may be present without anemia.

Infectious Complications of Burns Lawrence C. Madoff, Florencia Pereyra The skin is an essential component of immunity, protecting the host from potential pathogens in the environment. Breaches in this 166e protective barrier thus represent a form of immunocompromise that predisposes the patient to infection. Thermal burns may cause massive destruction of the integument as well as derangements in humoral and cellular immunity, permitting the development of infection caused by environmental opportunists and components of the host’s skin flora. Over the past decade, the estimated incidence of burn injuries in the United States has steadily declined; still, however, >1 million burn injuries are brought to medical attention each year. While many burn injuries are minor and require little or no intervention, 183,000 cases were reported between 2002 and 2011 to the National Burn Repository from specialized burn care facilities; of the 45,000 persons hospitalized for these injuries, 60% required intensive care and 20,000 had major burns involving at least 25% of the total body surface area. The majority of burn patients are men. Children under the age of 5 account for ~20% of all reported cases. Scalds, structural fires, and flammable liquids and gases are the major causes of burns, but electrical, chemical, and smoking-related sources also are important. Burns predispose to infection by damaging the protective barrier function of the skin, thus facilitating the entry of pathogenic microorganisms, and by inducing systemic immunosuppression. It is therefore not surprising that multiorgan failure and infectious complications are the major causes of morbidity and death in serious burn injury. More than 3000 patients in the United States die of burn-related infections each year, and 6 of the top 10 complications recently identified by the American Burn Association’s 10-year review are infectious: pneumonia (4.6%), septicemia (2.7%), cellulitis/traumatic injury (2.6%), respiratory failure (2.5%), wound infection (2.2%), another infection (2.0%), renal failure (1.5%), line infection (1.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1.2%), and arrhythmia (1.0%). Loss of the cutaneous barrier facilitates entry of the patient’s own flora and of organisms from the hospital environment into the burn wound. Initially, the wound is colonized with gram-positive bacteria from the surrounding tissue, but the number of bacteria grows rapidly beneath the burn eschar, reaching ~8.4 × 103 cfu/g on day 4 after the burn. The avascularity of the eschar, along with the impairment of local immune responses, favors further bacterial colonization and proliferation. By day 7, the wound is colonized with other microbes, including gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts derived from the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory flora. Invasive infection—localized and/or systemic—occurs when these bacteria penetrate viable tissue. In addition, a role for biofilms has been recognized in experimental animal models of burn-wound infection. (Biofilms are surface-associated communities of bacteria, often embedded in a matrix, that allow the microbes to persist and to resist the effects of host immunity and antimicrobial agents.)\n\n\n\nStreptococci and staphylococci were the predominant causes of burn-wound infection in the preantibiotic era and remain important pathogens at present. With the advent of antimicrobial agents, Pseudomonas aeruginosa became a major problem in burn-wound management. In animal models of cutaneous thermal injury and wound infection with Pseudomonas, there is an early, steady increase of neutrophils in the skin and bacterial dissemination to lungs and spleen within 72 h. Less common anaerobic bacteria are typically found in infections of electrical burns or when open wound dressings are used. The widespread use of topical and more effective antimicrobial agents has resulted in a decline in bacterial wound infections and the emergence of fungi (particularly Candida albicans, Aspergillus 166e-1 species, and the agents of mucormycosis) as increasingly important pathogens in burn-wound patients. Herpes simplex virus also has been found in burn wounds, especially those on the neck and face and those associated with inhalation injury. Cytomegalovirus viremia has been described in up to 71% of seropositive burn patients in prospective studies, and high levels (>1000 copies/mL) have been associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation and longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Autopsy reports from patients with severe thermal burns over the last decade have identified P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in association with mortality, independent of the percentage of total body surface area burned, the percentage of full-thickness burn, inhalation injury, and day of death after the burn. Indeed, burn trauma patients who acquire secondary\n\n\n\nP. aeruginosa infection have a fourfold greater mortality rate than those without P. aeruginosa. Historically, mortality rates among burn patients infected with P. aeruginosa have been as high as 77% over a 25-year period. In addition, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii is among the top pathogens in some burn centers. The cascade of events that follow a severe burn injury and that lead to multiorgan system failure and death is thought to represent a two-step process. The burn injury itself, with ensuing hypovolemia and tissue hypoxia, is followed by invasive infection arising from large amounts of devitalized tissue. The frequency of infection parallels the extent and severity of the burn injury. Severe burn injuries cause a state of immunosuppression that affects innate and adaptive immune responses. The substantial impact of immunocompromise on infection is due to effects on both the cellular and the humoral arms of the immune system. For example, decreases in the number and activity of circulating helper T cells, increases in suppressor T cells, decreases in production and release of monocytes and macrophages, and diminution in levels of immunoglobulin follow major burns. Neutrophil and complement functions also are impaired after burns. The increased levels of multiple cytokines detected in burn patients are compatible with the widely held belief that the inflammatory response becomes dysregulated in these individuals; bacterial cell products play a potent role in inducing proinflammatory mediators that contribute to this uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. Increased permeability of the gut wall to bacteria and their components (e.g., endotoxin) also contributes to immune dysregulation and sepsis. Thus, the burn patient is predisposed to infection at remote sites (see below) as well as at the sites of burn injury. Another contributor to secondary immunosuppression after burn injuries is the endocrine system; increasing levels of vasopressin, aldosterone, cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone, catecholamines, and other hormones that directly affect lymphocyte proliferation, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, natural killer cell activity, and suppressive T cells are seen. Since clinical indications of wound infection are difficult to interpret, wounds must be monitored carefully for changes that may reflect infection. A margin of erythema frequently surrounds the sites of burns and by itself is not usually indicative of infection. Signs of infection include the conversion of a partial-thickness to a full-thickness burn, color changes (e.g., the appearance of a dark brown or black discoloration of the wound), the new appearance of erythema or violaceous edema in normal tissue at the wound margins, the sudden separation of the eschar from subcutaneous tissues, and the degeneration of the wound with the appearance of a new eschar. Early surgical excision of devitalized tissue is now widely used, and burn-wound infections can be classified in relation to the excision site as (1) burn-wound impetigo (infection characterized by loss of epithelium from a previously re-epithelialized surface, as seen in a partial-thickness burn that is allowed to close by secondary intention, a grafted burn, or a healed skin donor site); (2) burn-related surgical-wound infection (purulent infection of excised burn and donor sites that have not yet epithelialized, accompanied by positive\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 166e Infectious Complications  of Burns\n\n\n\nFIGurE 166e-1 Cellulitis complicating a burn wound of the arm, with extension of the infection to adjacent healthy tissue.

The appearance of a green discoloration of the wound or subcutaneous fat (Fig. 166e-3) or the development of ecthyma gangrenosum (see Fig. 25e-35) at a remote site points to a diagnosis of invasive P. aeruginosa infection. Changes in body temperature, hypotension, tachycardia, altered mentation, neutropenia or neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure may result from invasive burn wounds and sepsis. However, because profound alterations in homeostasis occur as a consequence of burns per se and because inflammation without infection is a normal component of these injuries, the assessment of these changes is complicated. Alterations in body temperature, for example, are attributable to thermoregulatory dysfunction; tachycardia and hyperventilation accompany the metabolic changes induced by extensive burn injury and are not necessarily indicative of bacterial sepsis. Given the difficulty of evaluating burn wounds solely on the basis of clinical observation and laboratory data, wound biopsies are necessary\n\n\n\nFIGurE 166e-2 A severe upper-extremity burn infected with\n\n\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa.

Fifth-degree burns (through muscle to bone) and sixth degree burns (charring bone) were also described although are less common. Partial-thickness burns are classified as either superficial or deep partial-thickness burns by depth of involved dermis. Clinically, first-degree burns are painful but do not blis-ter, second-degree burns have dermal involvement and are extremely painful with weeping and blisters, and third-degree burns are leathery, painless, and nonblanching.

"A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has been increasingly reluctant to speak at school over the past 4 months. Her teachers complain that she does not answer their questions and it is affecting her academic performance. She was born at 35 weeks' gestation and pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia. Previous well-child examinations have been normal. Her older brother was diagnosed with a learning disability 4 years ago. She is at 65th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. She follows commands. She avoids answering questions directly and whispers her answers to her mother instead who then mediates between the doctor and her daughter. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A:Reactive attachment disorder

","['Special educational services should be individualized for the child. Occupational, speech, and physical therapy are oftenrequired. Referral for disability services and support is oftenwarranted. Potentially useful therapies tailored to the individual include applied behavioral analysis, discrete trialtraining, and structured teaching. There is a need for family support groups and individual supportive counseling for parents. The prognosis for autism is guarded. There are no known methods of primary prevention. Treatment and educational interventions are aimed at decreasing morbidity andmaximizing function. Autism, the prototypic pervasive developmental disorder, ischaracterized by lifelong marked impairment in reciprocal socialinteraction, communication, and a restricted range of activitiesand interests (Table 20-2). Approximately 20% of parents reportrelatively normal development until 1 or 2 years of age, followedby a steady or sudden decline. If no clinical manifestations ofthe disorder are present by 3 years of age, Rett syndrome orchildhood disintegrative disorder need to be considered. As aninfant, there is delayed or absent social smiling. The young childmay spend hours in solitary play and be socially withdrawnwith indifference to attempts at communication. Patients withautism often are not able to understand nonverbal communication (eye contact, facial expressions) and do not interact withpeople as significantly different from objects. Speech often isdelayed and, when present, it is frequently dominated by echolalia (sometimes mistaken as a sign of obsessive-compulsivedisorder [OCD]), perseveration (confused with psychosis or\n\n\n\nTable 20-1 Pervasive Developmental Disorder: Characteristics FEATURE AUTISM ASPERGER RETT CDD PDD-NOS Epidemiology 10 cases per 10,000; 5:1 male-to-female ratio 2.5 per 10,000; 5:1 male-to-female ratio 0.44 to 2.1 per 10,000; diagnosed only in girls; associated with MECP2 gene mutation 0.11 per 10,000 2 to 16 per 10,000\n\n\n\nCDD, Childhood disintegrative disorder; PDD-NOS, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified.

Twin studies have revealed high levels of concordance for monozygotic twins.

","['Glomerulonephritis may lead to dysmorphic red blood cells or red blood cell casts. Interstitial nephritis may lead to white blood cell casts. The urine sediment findings overlap somewhat in glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis, and a diagnosis is not always possible on the basis of the urine sediment alone. Urine eosinophils have a limited role in differential diagnosis; they can be seen in interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, cystitis, atheroembolic disease, or glomerulonephritis. Crystalluria may be important diagnostically. The finding of oxalate crystals in AKI should prompt an evaluation for ethylene glycol toxicity. Abundant uric acid crystals may be seen in the tumor lysis syndrome. Certain forms of AKI are associated with characteristic patterns in the rise and fall of SCr. Prerenal azotemia typically leads to modest rises in SCr that return to baseline with improvement in hemodynamic status. Contrast nephropathy leads to a rise in SCr within 24–48 h, peak within 3–5 days, and resolution within 5–7 days.

Depending on severity, the patient may be able to speak in full sentences or may be very short of breath.', 'If the criteria are to be maximally helpful in evaluating patients, appropriate data must be collected. Furthermore, clinical judgment must be exercised in order to use the criteria effectively. Documentation of two major criteria, of one major criterion and three minor criteria, or of five minor criteria allows a clinical diagnosis of definite endocarditis. The diagnosis of endocarditis is rejected if an alternative diagnosis is established, if symptoms resolve and do not recur with ≤4 days of antibiotic therapy, or if surgery or autopsy after ≤4 days of antimicrobial therapy yields no histologic evidence of endocarditis. Illnesses not classified as definite endocarditis or rejected as such are considered cases of possible infective endocarditis when either one major and one minor criterion or three minor criteria are fulfilled. Requiring some clinical features of endocarditis for classification as possible infective endocarditis increases the specificity of the schema without significantly reducing its sensitivity. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, patients with definite or possible endocarditis are treated as such.

","['The first are those who have associated structural heart disease that must be detected. The risk of life-threatening arrhythmias causing sudden death is indicated by the nature of the arrhythmia—sustained (or causing cardiac arrest) or nonsustained, in which case the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias is assessed from the severity of the heart disease, usually the severity of ventricular dysfunction. ICDs provide the most protection from sudden arrhythmic death. The second group comprises those who do not have recognizable structural heart disease, but have a genetic syndrome associated with increased risk of sudden death. A family history of sudden death and abnormal electrocardiogram most frequently suggest the diagnosis. The third group includes individuals with benign idiopathic arrhythmias who may require therapy to control symptoms, but who are not at significant risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. The appropriate recognition of these patients is facilitated by thoughtful application of ECG and cardiac imaging.

Rhythm is “irregularly irregular,” and rate is extremely rapid (about 230/min).', 'It is characterized by massive left ventricular hypertorphy associated with (paradoxically) a markedly reduced stroke volume. This latter occurs as a consequence of impaired diastolic filling and overall smaller chamber size. In addition, roughly 25% of patients have dynamic obstruction to the left ventricular outflow by the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Reduced cardiac output and a secondary increase in pulmonary venous pressure cause exertional dyspnea, with a harsh systolic ejection murmur. A combination of massive hypertrophy, high left ventricular pressures, and compromised intramural arteries frequently leads to myocardial ischemia (with angina), even in the absence of concomitant CAD. Major clinical problems include atrial fibrillation with mural thrombus formation, ventricular fibrillation leading to sudden cardiac death, infectious endocarditis of the mitral valve, and CHF. Most patients’ symptoms are improved by therapy that promotes ventricular relaxation; partial surgical excision or controlled alcohol-induced infarction of septal muscle also can relieve the outflow tract obstruction. As mentioned earlier, HCM is an important cause of sudden cardiac death. In almost one third of cases of sudden cardiac death in athletes younger than 35 years of age, the underlying cause is HCM. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by a primary decrease in ventricular compliance, resulting in impaired ventricular filling during diastole (simply put, the wall is stiffer). This form of cardiomyopathy may be idiopathic or may be associated with systemic diseases that affect the myocardium, for example, radiation fibrosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or products of inborn errors of metabolism. Three forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy merit brief mention:\n\n\n\nAmyloidosis is caused by the deposition of extracellular proteins with a predilection for forming insoluble β-pleated sheets (Chapter 5). Cardiac amyloidosis can occur in the setting of systemic amyloidosis (e.g., multiple myeloma) or can be predominantly restricted to the heart (e.g., senile cardiac amyloidosis). In the latter case, deposition of normal (or mutant) forms of transthyretin (a liver-synthesized circulating protein that transports thyroxine and retinol) in the hearts of older adult patients results in a restrictive cardiomyopathy. Four percent of African Americans carry a specific mutation of transthyretin that increases the risk of cardiac amyloidosis in that population over fourfold. Besides depositing as amyloid, immunoglobulin light-chains in AL-type amyloid also are directly cardiotoxic and can induce myocardial dysfunction. Endomyocardial fibrosis is principally a disease of children and young adults in Africa and other tropical areas.']","['The relevant sentence extracted from the provided context is:\n\n""HCM is an important cause of sudden cardiac death', 'In almost one third of cases of sudden cardiac death in athletes younger than 35 years of age, the underlying cause is HCM.""']",0.023255813953488372,"['Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is defined as unexpected death due to a lethal arrhythmia such as asystole or sustained ventricular fibrillation.

TTE is indicated in all cases of suspected acute, severe MR to define its mechanism and severity, delineate left ventricular size and systolic function, and provide an assessment of suitability for primary valve repair. A congenital, small muscular VSD (Chap. 282) may be associated with an early systolic murmur. The defect closes progressively during septal contraction, and thus, the murmur is confined to early systole. It is localized to the left sternal border (Fig. 51e-2) and is usually of grade 4 or 5 intensity. Signs of pulmonary hypertension or left ventricular volume overload are absent. Anatomically large and uncorrected VSDs, which usually involve the membranous portion of the septum, may lead to pulmonary hypertension. The murmur associated with the left-to-right shunt, which earlier may have been holosystolic, becomes limited to the first portion of systole as the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance leads to an abrupt rise in right ventricular pressure and an attenuation of the interventricular pressure gradient during the remainder of the cardiac cycle. In such instances, signs of pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular lift, loud and single or closely split S2) may predominate. The murmur is best heard along the left sternal border but is softer. Suspicion of a VSD is an indication for TTE. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with normal pulmonary artery pressures, as may occur with infective endocarditis, may produce an early systolic murmur. The murmur is soft (grade 1 or 2), is best heard at the lower left sternal border, and may increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallo’s sign). Regurgitant “c-v” waves may be visible in the jugular venous pulse. TR in this setting is not associated with signs of right heart failure. Mid-Systolic Murmurs Mid-systolic murmurs begin at a short interval after , end before S (Fig. 51e-1C), and are usually crescendo-decrescendo in configuration. Aortic stenosis is the most common cause of a mid-systolic murmur in an adult. The murmur of AS is usually loudest to the right of the sternum in the second intercostal space (aortic area, Fig. 51e-2) and radiates into the carotids. Transmission of the mid-systolic murmur to the apex, where it becomes higher-pitched, is common (Gallavardin effect; see above). Differentiation of this apical systolic murmur from MR can be difficult. The murmur of AS will increase in intensity, or become louder, in the beat after a premature beat, whereas the murmur of MR will have constant intensity from beat to beat. The intensity of the AS murmur also varies directly with the cardiac output. With a normal cardiac output, a systolic thrill and a grade 4 or higher murmur suggest severe AS. The murmur is softer in the setting of heart failure and low cardiac output. Other auscultatory findings of severe AS include a soft or absent A2, paradoxical splitting of S2, an apical S4, and a late-peaking systolic murmur. In children, adolescents, and young adults with congenital valvular AS, an early ejection sound (click) is usually audible, more often along the left sternal border than at the base. Its presence signifies a flexible, noncalcified bicuspid valve (or one of its variants) and localizes the left ventricular outflow obstruction to the valvular (rather than subor supravalvular) level. Assessment of the volume and rate of rise of the carotid pulse can provide additional information. A small and delayed upstroke (parvus et tardus) is consistent with severe AS. The carotid pulse examination is less discriminatory, however, in older patients with stiffened arteries. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) as the severity of the stenosis increases. TTE is indicated to assess the anatomic features of the aortic valve, the severity of the stenosis, left ventricular size, wall thickness and function, and the size and contour of the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta. The obstructive form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is associated with a mid-systolic murmur that is usually loudest along the left sternal border or between the left lower sternal border and the apex (Chap. 287, Fig.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['The transthoracic echocardiogram typically shows pericardial thickening, dilation of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, and a sharp halt in ventricular filling in early diastole, with normal ventricular systolic function and flattening of the left ventricular posterior wall.

During inspiration, there is an exaggerated reduction in blood flow velocity in the pulmonary veins and across the mitral valve and a leftward shift of the ventricular septum; the opposite occurs during expiration. Diastolic flow velocity in the inferior vena cava into the right atrium and across the tricuspid valve increases in an exaggerated manner during inspiration and declines during expiration (Fig. 288-4). However, echocardiography cannot definitively exclude the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis.

N.', '1996, 335:343–345. The adaptive immune response is a critical component of host defense against infection and is essential for normal health. Antigens not associated with infectious agents sometimes elicit adaptive immune responses, and this can cause disease. One circumstance in which this happens is when harmful immunologically mediated hypersensitivity reactions known generally as allergic reactions occur in response to inherently harmless ‘environmental’ antigens such as pollen, food, and drugs. Historically, hypersensitivity reactions due to immunological responses were classified by Gell and Coombs into four broad types, of which type I hypersensitivity reactions represented immediate-type allergic reactions mediated by IgE antibodies, with mast-cell activation the major final effector mechanism. Type II and III hypersensitivity responses were defined as those that were driven by antigen-specific IgG antibodies, the final effector mechanism being complement (type II) or FcR-bearing cellular effectors (type III). Finally, type IV hypersensitivity responses were depicted as being driven by cellular effectors, including lymphocytes and a variety of myeloid cell types. While the Gell and Coombs classification system provides an effective framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying some prototypic immunologic reactions, it is now becoming clear that most normal and pathologic host immune responses involve both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system, and that the definitions provided in Chapter 11 for types 1, 2, and 3 immune response modules provide a more thorough mechanistic context for understanding disease pathogenesis, including allergic responses (see Fig. 11.5). In most allergic reactions, such as those to food, pollen, or house dust, reactions occur because the individual has become sensitized to an innocuous anti-gen—the allergen—by producing IgE antibodies against it. This is usually a result of the formation of an unwanted type 2 immune response to the allergen. Subsequent exposure to the allergen triggers the activation of IgE-binding cells, chiefly mast cells and basophils, in the exposed tissue, leading to a series of responses that are characteristic of this type of allergic reaction. In hay fever (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis), for example, symptoms occur when allergenic proteins leached out of grass or weed pollen grains come into contact with the mucous membrane of the nose and eyes. In contrast, other hypersensitivity disorders, such as allergic contact dermatitis, serum sickness, or celiac disease, are not dependent on IgE antibodies and represent unwanted immune responses driven by IgG antibodies and/or cellular immune responses. We are all exposed regularly to common environmental agents that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. While most of the population does not develop clinically significant allergic reactions to the majority of potential allergens, in some surveys over half of the population shows an allergic response to at least one substance in the environment. Some individuals manifest allergic responses to multiple common antigens. A predisposition to become IgE-sensitized to environmental allergens is called atopy, and later in the chapter we discuss the various factors—both genetic and environmental— that may contribute to this predisposition. Genetic factors clearly play a role in predisposing an individual to IgE-mediated allergic disease. If both parents are atopic, a child has a 40–60% chance of developing an IgE-mediated allergy, whereas the risk is much lower, on the order of 10%, if neither parent is atopic. IgE and IgE-mediated allergic\xa0diseases. Effector mechanisms in IgE-mediated allergic reactions. Non-IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Fig. 14.1 IgE-mediated reactions to extrinsic antigens. All IgE-mediated responses involve mast-cell degranulation, but the symptoms experienced by the patient can be very different depending, for example, on whether the allergen is injected directly into the bloodstream, is eaten, or comes into contact with the mucosa of the ocular or respiratory tract. IgE is prominent in the defense against extracellular parasitic organisms, especially helminths and protozoa (see Section 11-9). These parasitic organisms are prevalent in developing nations, but most serum IgE in developed nations is directed against innocuous antigens, sometimes causing allergic symptoms (Fig. 14.1). Almost half the population of North America and Europe is sensitized to one or more common environmental antigens, and, although rarely life-threatening, allergic diseases initiated by contact with a specific allergen can cause much distress and lost time from school and work. The burden of allergic diseases in the Western world is considerable, with their prevalence having more than doubled in the past 20 years. Consequently, most clinical and scientific attention paid to IgE has been directed toward its pathologic roles in allergic disease rather than its protective capacity. Until the last decade, developing countries in Africa and the Middle East reported a relatively low prevalence of allergy; however, this situation is rapidly changing, probably as a result of Western-style modernization. In this chapter we first consider the mechanisms that favor the sensitization of an individual to an allergen, resulting in the production of antigen-specific IgE. We then describe the IgE-mediated allergic reaction itself—the pathological consequences of the interaction between allergen and the IgE bound to the high-affinity Fcε receptor on mast cells and basophils. Finally, we consider the causes and consequences of other types of immunological hypersensitivity reaction. IgE and IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are those allergic reactions caused by activation of mast cells and basophils by multivalent antigen bridging IgE bound to their cell surfaces. IgE differs from other antibody isotypes in being predominantly localized in the tissues, where it is tightly bound to the surfaces\n\n\n\nIgE and IgE-mediated allergic diseases.

Der p 1 is a (third panel), and this IgE becomes bound to Fc receptors on common respiratory allergen that is found in fecal pellets of the resident submucosal mast cells. On a subsequent encounter with house dust mite. When an atopic individual first encounters Der p 1, Der p 1, the allergen binds to the mast cell-bound IgE, triggering subepithelial dendritic cells ingest the allergenic protein and traffic mast-cell activation and the release of mast-cell granule contents, to the draining lymph node, where TH2 cells specific for Der p 1 are which cause the symptoms of the allergic reaction (last panel). produced (first and second panels). Interaction of these T cells with Der p\xa01 is a protease that cleaves occludin, a protein that helps to Der p 1-specific B cells leads to the production of class-switched maintain epithelial tight junctions; the enzymatic activity of Der p 1 is plasma cells producing Der p 1-specific IgE in the mucosal tissues thought to help it pass through the epithelium. of mast cells and some other cell types through the high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRI (see Section 10-24). Binding of antigen to IgE cross-links the high-affinity IgE receptors, causing the release of chemical mediators from the mast cells that can lead to allergic disease (Fig. 14.2). How an initial antibody response to environmental antigens comes to be dominated by IgE production in atopic individuals is still being worked out. In this part of the chapter we describe the current understanding of the factors that contribute to this process. 14-1 Sensitization involves class switching to IgE production on first contact with an allergen. To produce an allergic reaction against a given antigen, an individual must first be exposed to the antigen under conditions that result in the production of IgE antibodies. Allergic symptoms occur when an individual who has been sensitized in this fashion has subsequent exposure to the antigen. Exposure can lead to different clusters of symptoms, characterized by the tissues that are most prominently affected. The most common forms of allergic response in developed countries are to airborne allergens, causing symptoms that affect predominantly the nasal passages (allergic rhinitis), the eyes (allergic conjunctivitis), or the lower airways and lungs (asthma). Ingested allergens can lead to food allergy, sometimes affecting only the gastrointestinal tract (for example, eosinophilic esophagitis), but not infrequently involving locations distant from the site of antigen entry. Reactions that occur at locations distant from the site of entry of the challenging antigen are considered to be systemic reactions, and are thought to occur because of spread of the antigen throughout the body via the blood circulation. Systemic reactions can be limited to a single distant organ, causing hives (also called urticaria) when they target the skin, wheezing (or bronchospasms) when they involve the lungs, and life-threatening lowering of the blood pressure when they target the vascular system. Serious systemic reactions are designated by the term anaphylaxis. It is not known why sensitization with a particular allergen in one individual leads to local reactions at the time of allergen challenge, whereas sensitization with the same allergen can yield anaphylaxis in another individual. In fact, even in a single individual, a challenge that usually yields only a mild local reaction can be followed at the time of another challenge by a severe systemic reaction. Atopic individuals often develop sensitization to many different antigens, and can express multiple forms of allergic symptoms, which depend on the route and quantity of allergen—for example, atopic eczema that develops in childhood in response to sensitization to food antigens is followed in a sizable proportion of those individuals developing allergic rhinitis and/or asthma in response to airborne allergens. This progression of allergic responses in some individuals from atopic eczema in childhood to allergic rhinitis and eventually to asthma in later life has been termed the atopic march. Allergic reactions in non-atopic people, in contrast, are predominantly due to sensitization to one specific allergen, such as bee venom or a drug such as penicillin, and can develop at any time of life. It is important to remember, however, that not all encounters with a potential allergen will lead to sensitization, and not all sensitizations will lead to a symptomatic allergic response, even in atopic individuals. The immune response leading to IgE production in response to antigen is driven by two main groups of signals that together are typical of type 2 immune reactions. The first consists of signals that favor the differentiation of naive T cells to a TH2 phenotype. The second comprises TH2 cytokines and co-stimulatory signals that stimulate B cells to switch to the production of IgE. As described in Section 9-21, the fate of a naive CD4 T cell responding to an antigenic peptide presented by a dendritic cell is determined by the cytokines it is exposed to before and during this response, and by the intrinsic properties of the antigen, the antigen dose, and the route of presentation. Exposure to IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 favors the development of TH2 cells, whereas exposure to IFN-γ and IL-12 (and its relative IL-27) favors TH1-cell development. Immune defenses against multicellular parasites are found mainly at the sites of parasite entry, namely, under the skin and in the mucosal tissues of the airways and the gut. Cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems at these sites are specialized to secrete cytokines that promote a type 2 response to parasitic infection. In the presence of an invading parasite, dendritic cells taking up antigens in these tissues migrate to regional lymph nodes, where they tend to drive antigen-specific naive CD4 T cells to become effector TH2 cells. TH2 cells themselves secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, thus maintaining an environment in which further differentiation of TH2 cells is favored. The cytokine IL-33, which can be produced by activated mast cells and by damaged or injured epithelial cells, also contributes to amplification of the TH2 response. IL-33 can act directly on TH2 cells via the IL-33 receptors that these cells express. Allergic responses against common environmental antigens are normally avoided because mucosal dendritic cells that encounter antigen in the absence of danger signals such as those provoked by microbial infection generally induce naive CD4 T cells to differentiate into antigen-specific regulatory T cells (T cells). The T cells suppress T-cell responses and contribute to a state of tolerance to the antigen (see Section 12-8) rather than allowing the production of effector or helper cells that might support the production of an allergic response. The cytokines and chemokines produced by TH2 cells both amplify the TH2 response and stimulate the class switching of activated B cells to IgE production. As we saw in Chapter 10, IL-4 or IL-13 provides the first signal that switches B cells to IgE production. IL-4 and IL-13 acting on T and B lymphocytes activate the Janus-family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3 (see Section 7-20), ultimately leading to phosphorylation (and thereby activation) of the transcriptional regulator STAT6. Mice lacking functional IL-4, IL-13, or STAT6 have impaired TH2 responses and an impaired ability to switch to production of IgE, demonstrating the key importance of these cytokines and their signaling pathways in the IgE response. The second signal for IgE production is a co-stimulatory interaction between CD40 ligand on the T-cell surface and CD40 on the B-cell surface. This interaction is essential for all antibody class switching. Patients with a genetic deficiency of CD40 ligand produce no IgG, IgA, or IgE, and display a hyper-IgM syndrome phenotype (see Section 13-9). Murine mast cells and basophils can also produce the signals that drive IgE production by B cells. Mast cells and basophils express FcεRI, and when they are activated by antigen cross-linking their FcεRI-bound IgE, they express cell-surface CD40 ligand and secrete IL-4. Similar data exist for human basophils that have also been primed by inflammatory stimuli (Fig. 14.3). Like TH2 cells, they can induce class switching and IgE production by B cells. Generally, class switching to IgE occurs in lymph nodes (secondary lymphoid organs) that drain the site of antigen entry or in inducible lymphoid follicles (also called tertiary lymphoid tissues) that form in mucosal and other tissues at sites of persistent inflammation. The potential for formation in mucosal tissues of tertiary lymphoid follicles with germinal centers containing B cells that have switched to production of IgE means that mast cells or basophils can amplify the B-cell response close to the site of the allergic reaction. One goal of therapy for allergies is to block this amplification process and thus prevent allergic reactions from becoming self-sustaining. In humans, the IgE response, once initiated, can also be amplified by the capture of IgE by Fcε receptors on dendritic cells. Some populations of human immature dendritic cells—for example, the Langerhans cells of the skin— express surface FcεRI in an inflammatory setting, and once anti-allergen IgE antibodies have been produced, they can bind to these receptors. The bound IgE forms a highly effective trap for allergen, which is then efficiently processed by the dendritic cell for presentation to naive T cells, thus maintaining and reinforcing the TH2 response to the allergen. Eosinophils have also been reported to express IgE receptors, but this is still controversial. Eosinophils may act as antigen-presenting cells to T cells in a standard fashion after upregulation of eosinophil MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules; however, this probably occurs in tissues where activated T cells have migrated rather than in lymph nodes where naive T cells are primed by dendritic cells. 14-2 Although many types of antigens can cause allergic sensitization, proteases are common sensitizing agents. Most airborne allergens are relatively small, highly soluble proteins that are carried on dry particles such as pollen grains or mite feces (Fig. 14.4). On contact with the mucus-covered epithelia of the eyes, nose, or airways, the soluble allergen is eluted from the particle and diffuses into the mucosa, where it can be picked up by dendritic cells and provoke sensitization (see Fig. 14.2). At mucosal surfaces, allergens are typically presented to the immune system at low concentrations. It has been estimated that the maximum exposure of a person to the common pollen allergens in ragweed (Ambrosia species) does not exceed 1 μg per year. It is thought that low-dose sensitization favors formation of a strong TH2 response. Consequently, these minute doses of allergen can provoke irritating and even life-threatening TH2-driven IgE antibody responses in atopic individuals. Antigen exposures that lead to allergic responses do not always involve such low doses of antigen, especially at other tissue sites. For example, bee venom is a frequent cause of allergic sensitization, and individual bee stings result in the injection into the skin of 20–75 μg of bee venom (1 to 2 orders of magnitude more than the total dose of ragweed antigen that is inhaled into the airways). In the case of food allergy, ingestion of many grams of an allergenic food into the gastrointestinal tract over prolonged periods of time can lead to sensitization. Sensitization can also occur in response to small or large doses of injected antigens. For example, before the introduction of recombinant\n\n\n\nTop\xa0panel: IgE secreted by plasma cells binds to the high-affinity IgE receptor on basophils (illustrated here) and mast cells. Bottom panel: when the surface-bound IgE is cross-linked by antigen, these cells express CD40 ligand (CD40L) and secrete IL-4, which in turn binds to IL-4 receptors (IL-4R) on the activated B cell. Together with ligation of B-cell CD40 by basophil CD40L, this activates class switching by the B cell and the production of more IgE. These interactions can occur in vivo at the site of allergen-triggered inflammation, for example, in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. human insulin, individuals with diabetes could develop allergy to porcine insulin, usually administered in doses of 1–2 milligrams per injection. In contrast, doses of penicillin-type drugs (including cephalosporins and other β-lactam-containing antibiotics) that can lead to sensitization when administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection are usually in the 1to 2-gram per injection range. Considerable effort has been directed toward identifying physical, chemical, or functional characteristics that might be common for all allergens, but no common characteristics of all allergens have emerged. Thus, it appears that in a susceptible host, essentially any antigenic molecule can elicit an allergic response. While any type of molecule appears to be able to elicit an allergic response, the search for common features of allergenic molecules has demonstrated that some clinically significant allergens are proteases. One ubiquitous protease allergen is the cysteine protease Der p 1, which is present in the feces of the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Der p 1 provokes allergic reactions in about 20% of the North American population. This enzyme has been found to cleave occludin, a protein component of intercellular tight junctions in the airway mucosa. This reveals one possible reason for the allergenicity of certain enzymes. By destroying the integrity of the tight junctions between epithelial cells, Der p 1 may gain abnormal access to subepithelial antigen-presenting cells (see Fig. 14.2). The tendency of proteases to induce IgE production is highlighted by individuals with Netherton’s syndrome (Fig. 14.5), which is characterized by high levels of IgE and multiple allergies. This disease is caused by a mutation in SPINK5 (serine protease inhibitor Kazaltype 5), which encodes the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI (lymphoepithelial Kazal type-related inhibitor). LEKTI is expressed in the most differentiated viable layer of the skin (the granular cell layer), just internal to the cornified cell layer of the epidermis. Absence of LEKTI in Netherton’s syndrome results in overly active epidermal kallikreins, proteases that can cleave desmosomes in the skin, leading to keratinocyte shedding and disturbed skin barrier function. Overly active kallikrein 5 leads to overexpression in the skin of TNF-α, ICAM-1, IL-8, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP is a major agonist of allergic manifestations in the skin, and is essential for the development of both the eczematous skin lesions and the allergic manifestations (including food allergy) seen in Netherton’s syndrome. Additionally, LEKTI is thought to inhibit the proteases released by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. This may be of special significance in the eczematous process, since a very large fraction of individuals with chronic eczema show persistent colonization with S. aureus and resolution of the eczema is facilitated by elimination of the Staphylococcus, in addition to suppression of the inflammatory response. The observation that loss-of-function mutations in a protease inhibitor in Netherton’s syndrome led to the development of multiple allergies provides additional support for the possibility that protease inhibitors might be novel therapeutic targets in some allergic disorders. Furthermore, the cysteine protease papain, derived from the papaya fruit, is used as a meat. Papain can\n\n\n\nFig. 14.5 Netherton’s syndrome illustrates the association of proteases with the development of high levels of IgE and allergy. This 26-year-old man with Netherton’s syndrome, caused by a deficiency in the protease inhibitor SPINK5, had persistent erythroderma (redness of the skin), recurrent infections of the skin and other tissues, and multiple food allergies associated with high serum IgE levels.

Around 150 deaths occur each year in the United States as a result of a severe allergic reaction to food, with peanut and tree nut allergies accounting for most of the deaths. Peanut allergy is a significant public health problem, especially in schools, where children may be unwittingly exposed to peanuts, which are present in many foods. Recent studies offer hope for reducing the incidence of severe food allergy. In one study, infants with severe eczema who were at high risk for developing peanut allergy were randomly assigned either to be fed peanuts regularly, starting between ages 4 and 11 months, or to be on a peanut-avoidance diet for 5 years. At the age of 5, the children who had consumed peanuts showed more than a threefold reduction in the frequency of peanut allergy; the reduction was associated with decreased production of peanut-specific IgE. This suggests that deliberate introduction into the', 'IgE-mediated food allergies affect about 1–4% of American and European adults and are slightly more frequent in children (around 5%). About 25% of food allergy in children is due to peanuts, and peanut allergy is increasing in incidence. Figure 14.15 lists risk factors for developing IgE-mediated food allergy. IgE-mediated food allergy can manifest itself in a variety of ways, ranging from a swelling of the lips and oral tissue on contact with the allergen, to gastrointestinal cramping, diarrhea, or vomiting. Local gastrointestinal symptoms are due to activation of mucosal mast cells, leading to transepithelial fluid loss and smooth muscle contractions. Food allergens that subsequently reach the bloodstream can lead to urticaria, asthma, and, in the most severe cases, systemic anaphylaxis that can lead to cardiovascular collapse (see Section 14-10). Certain foods, most importantly peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish, are particularly associated with severe anaphylaxis. Around 150 deaths']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0
"An 18-month-old boy is brought in to the pediatrician by his mother for concerns that her child is becoming more and more yellow over the past two days. She additionally states that the boy has been getting over a stomach flu and has not been able to keep down any food. The boy does not have a history of neonatal jaundice. On exam, the patient appears slightly sluggish and jaundiced with icteric sclera. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 88/56 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. His labs demonstrate an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia of 16 mg/dL. It is determined that the best course of treatment for this patient is phenobarbital to increase liver enzyme synthesis.

","['(Chapter 7). In contrast, conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble, nontoxic, and only loosely bound to albumin. Because of its solubility and weak association with albumin, excess conjugated bilirubin in plasma can be excreted in urine. Serum bilirubin levels in the normal adult vary between 0.3 and 1.2 mg/dL. Jaundice becomes evident when the serum bilirubin levels rise above 2 to 2.5 mg/dL; levels as high as 30 to 40 mg/dL can occur with severe disease. Causes of conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia differ, and so measurement of both forms is of value in evaluating a patient with jaundice. Because the hepatic machinery for conjugating and excreting bilirubin does not fully mature until about 2 weeks of age, almost every newborn develops transient and mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, termed neonatal jaundice or physiologic jaundice of the newborn. This may be exacerbated by breastfeeding, due to the action of bilirubindeconjugating enzymes in breast milk. Nevertheless, sustained jaundice in the newborn is abnormal and is discussed later in the “ ” section. Jaundice also may result from inborn errors of metabolism, including the following: • Gilbert syndrome is a common (7% of the population) inherited condition that manifests as fluctuating unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia of variable severity. The primary cause is mildly decreased hepatic levels of glucuronosyltransferase attributed to a mutation in the encoding gene, UGT1A1; polymorphisms in the gene may play a role in the variable expression of this disorder. Gilbert syndrome is not associated with any morbidity. By contrast, severe glucuronosyltransferase deficiency causes a rare disorder called Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 1 that is fatal in infancy. • Dubin-Johnson syndrome results from an autosomal recessive defect in the transport protein responsible for hepatocellular excretion of bilirubin glucuronides across the canalicular membrane. Affected individuals exhibit conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Other than having a darkly pigmented liver (from polymerized epinephrine metabolites, not bilirubin) and hepatomegaly, patients are normal. Cholestasis is a condition caused by extrahepatic or intrahepatic obstruction of bile channels or by defects in hepatocyte bile secretion. Patients may have jaundice, pruritus, skin xanthomas (focal accumulation of cholesterol), or symptoms related to intestinal malabsorption, including nutritional deficiencies of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, or K. A characteristic laboratory finding is elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), enzymes that are present on the apical membranes of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

The most common cause of bile duct obstruction in adults is extrahepatic cholelithiasis (gallstones, discussed later), followed by malignant obstructions, and post-surgical strictures. Obstructive conditions in children include biliary atresia, cystic fibrosis, choledochal cysts (a cystic anomaly of the extrahepatic biliary tree), and syndromes in which there are insufficient intrahepatic bile ducts (paucity of bile duct syndromes). The initial morphologic features of cholestasis have been discussed and are entirely reversible with correction of the obstruction.

This ""bloody show"" is the consequence of efacement and dilation of the cervix, with tearing of small vessels. Uterine bleeding above the cervix, however, is concerning. It may follow some separation of a placenta previa implanted in the immediate vicinity of the cervical canal, or it may be from a placental abruption or uterine tear. In some women, especially with a placenta previa, cervical varicosities may bleed (O\'Brien, 2013).

","['Are there any palpable masses or nodules? Each question must be answered (with the exclusion of all other inputs) before the examiner can move on to the next specific question. Each diagnostic hypothesis provides testable predictions and sets a context for the next question or step to follow. For example, if the enlarged and quite tender liver felt on physical examination is due to acute hepatitis (the hypothesis), certain specific liver function tests should be markedly elevated (the prediction). If the tests come back normal, the hypothesis may have to be discarded or substantially modified. Negative findings often are neglected but are as important as positive ones because they often reduce the likelihood of the diagnostic hypotheses under consideration. Chest discomfort that is not provoked or worsened by exertion in an active patient reduces the likelihood that chronic ischemic heart disease is the underlying cause. The absence of a resting tachycardia and thyroid gland enlargement reduces the likelihood of hyperthyroidism in a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The acuity of a patient’s illness may override considerations of prevalence and the other issues described above.', 'Lung examination can reveal adventitious sounds indicative of pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or pleuritis. Abdomen In some patients with advanced obstructive lung disease, the point of maximal cardiac impulse may be in the epigastrium. The liver is frequently enlarged and tender in patients with chronic heart failure. Systolic pulsations over the liver signify severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Splenomegaly may be a feature of infective endocarditis, particularly when symptoms have persisted for weeks or months. Ascites is a nonspecific finding but may be present with advanced chronic right heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, hepatic cirrhosis, or an intraperitoneal malignancy. The finding of an elevated JVP implies a cardiovascular etiology. In nonobese patients, the aorta typically is palpated between the epigastrium and the umbilicus. The sensitivity of palpation for the detection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (pulsatile and expansile mass) decreases as a function of body size. Because palpation alone is not sufficiently accurate to establish this diagnosis, a screening ultrasound examination is advised. The 1443 presence of an arterial bruit over the abdomen suggests high-grade atherosclerotic disease, although precise localization is difficult. Extremities The temperature and color of the extremities, the presence of clubbing, arachnodactyly, and pertinent nail findings can be surmised quickly during the examination. Clubbing implies the presence of central right-to-left shunting, although it has also been described in patients with endocarditis. Its appearance can range from cyanosis and softening of the root of the nail bed, to the classic loss of the normal angle between the base of the nail and the skin, to the skeletal and periosteal bony changes of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, which is seen rarely in patients with advanced lung or liver disease. Patients with the Holt-Oram syndrome have an unopposable, “fingerized” thumb, whereas patients with Marfan’s syndrome may have arachnodactyly and a positive “wrist” (overlapping of the thumb and fifth finger around the wrist) or “thumb” (protrusion of the thumb beyond the ulnar aspect of the hand when the fingers are clenched over the thumb in a fist) sign. The Janeway lesions of endocarditis are non- tender, slightly raised hemorrhages on the palms and soles, whereas Osler’s nodes are tender, raised nodules on the pads of the fingers or toes. Splinter hemorrhages are classically identified as linear petechiae in the midposition of the nail bed and should be distinguished from the more common traumatic petechiae, which are seen closer to the distal edge.

","['One problem in interpreting these prognostic variables is that most of them have not been examined in a study using a large cohort of patients. adjuvant regimens Adjuvant therapy is the use of systemic therapies in patients whose known disease has received local therapy but who are at risk of relapse. Selection of appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy is highly controversial in some situations. Meta-analyses have helped to define broad limits for therapy but do not help in choosing optimal regimens or in choosing a regimen for certain subgroups of patients. A summary of recommendations is shown in Table 108-3. In general, premenopausal women for whom any form of adjuvant systemic therapy is indicated should receive multidrug chemotherapy. Antihormone therapy improves survival in premenopausal patients who are estrogen receptor positive and should be added following completion of chemotherapy. Prophylactic surgical or medically induced castration may also be associated with a substantial survival benefit (primarily in estrogen receptor–positive patients) but is not widely used in this country. Data on postmenopausal women are also controversial. The impact of adjuvant chemotherapy is quantitatively less clear-cut than in premenopausal patients, particularly in estrogen receptor– positive cases, although survival advantages have been shown. The first decision is whether chemotherapy or endocrine therapy should be used. While adjuvant endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen) improves survival regardless of axillary lymph node status, the improvement in survival is modest for patients in whom multiple lymph nodes are involved. For this reason, it has been usual to give chemotherapy to postmenopausal patients who have no medical contraindications and who have more than one positive lymph node; hormone therapy is commonly given subsequently. For postmenopausal women for whom systemic therapy is warranted but who have a more favorable prognosis (based more commonly on analysis such as the Oncotype DX methodology), hormone therapy may be used alone. Large clinical trials have aAs determined by pathologic examination. shown superiority for aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen alone in the adjuvant setting, although tamoxifen appears essentially equivalent in women who are obese and therefore presumably have higher endogenous concentrations of estrogen. Unfortunately the optimal plan is unclear. Tamoxifen for 5 years followed by an aromatase inhibitor, the reverse strategy, or even switching to an aromatase inhibitor after 2–3 years of tamoxifen has been shown to be better than tamoxifen alone. Continuation of tamoxifen for 10 years yields further benefit and is a reasonable decision for women with less favorable prognoses. Unfortunately, multiple studies have revealed very suboptimal adherence to long-term adjuvant endocrine regimens, and every effort should be made to encourage their continuous use. No valid information currently permits selection among the three clinically approved aromatase inhibitors. Concomitant use of bisphosphonates is almost always warranted; however, it is not finally settled as to whether their prophylactic use increases survival in addition to just decreasing recurrences in bone. Most comparisons of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens show little difference among them, although small advantages for doxorubicincontaining regimens and “dose-dense” regimens are usually seen.', 'B. Cancer\n\n\n\nThe relation of estrogen therapy to cancer continues to be the subject of active investigation. Although no adverse effect of short-term estrogen therapy on the incidence of breast cancer has been demonstrated, a small increase in the incidence of this tumor may occur with prolonged therapy. Although the risk factor is small (1.25), the impact may be great since this tumor occurs in 10% of women, and addition of progesterone does not confer a protective effect. Studies indicate that following unilateral excision of breast cancer, women receiving tamoxifen (an estrogen partial agonist, see below) show a 35% decrease in contralateral breast cancer compared with controls. These studies also demonstrate that tamoxifen is well tolerated by most patients, produces estrogen-like alterations in plasma lipid levels, and stabilizes bone mineral loss. Studies bearing on the possible efficacy of tamoxifen and raloxifene in postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer show decreases of risk for at least 5 years, but of unknown further duration. Another study showed that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy with estrogens plus progestins was associated with greater breast epithelial cell proliferation and breast epithelial cell density than estrogens alone or no replacement therapy. Furthermore, with estrogens plus progestins, breast proliferation was localized to the terminal duct-lobular unit of the breast, which is the main site of development of breast cancer. Thus, further studies are needed to conclusively assess the possible association between progestins and breast cancer risk. Many studies show an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma in patients taking estrogens alone. The risk seems to vary with the dose and duration of treatment: 15 times greater in patients taking large doses of estrogen for 5 or more years, in contrast with two to four times greater in patients receiving lower doses for short periods. However, as noted above, the concomitant use of a progestin prevents this increased risk and may in fact reduce the incidence of endometrial cancer to less than that in the general population. There have been a number of reports of adenocarcinoma of the vagina in young women whose mothers were treated with large doses of diethylstilbestrol early in pregnancy. These cancers are most common in young women (ages 14–44). The incidence is less than 1 per 1000 women exposed—too low to establish a cause-andeffect relationship with certainty.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['C.

","['48). Buspirone, a specific serotonin 5-HT2 agonist, has been promoted as effective in the treatment of anxiety and as a surrogate for benzodiazepines, but to us its benefit has seemed to be slight. It is important to point out that during the initial weeks of administration of antidepressants, the underlying anxiety symptoms may worsen and an anxiolytic is usually required until the antidepressant becomes effective. Propranolol, 10 to 20 mg tid, or a long-acting form of adrenergic blocker, can reduce many of the autonomic accompaniments of anxiety and is useful to many patients. Psychiatric consultation is, of course, invaluable. With regard to psychotherapy, behavioral therapy (progressive exposure of the patient to panic-provoking situations) is said to be beneficial, particularly if agoraphobia is a major symptom. Relaxation activities, including biofeedback and meditation, help many patients, although persistence is required in performing these exercises at least once daily and they are less helpful once a panic attack has begun. Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, which is discussed in relation to the treatment of depression in Chap. 48, also appears to be useful in the treatment of panic disorder, according to Andreasen and Black. A cardiac consultation and some simple tests (electrocardiogram, chest films) are often needed to reinforce to the patient the benign nature of the cardiac and respiratory symptoms and to alleviate fear of heart disease. These and other concepts of the treatment of anxiety were discussed by Goodwin and Guze. Anxiety symptoms arising in relation to a particular threatening event in a nonneurotic individual carry the best prognosis, but the symptoms may be prolonged, a feature of posttraumatic stress disorder. In this state, patients are overwhelmed by an intense and irrational fear of some animal, object, social situation, or disease. Although acknowledging that there are no grounds for a particular fear (hence it is not a delusion) and that such provocative stimuli are for the most part innocuous, the patient is nonetheless powerless to suppress it. This disorder was known to Hippocrates, who drew a distinction between normal and morbid fears. Westphal, in 1871, was the first to give morbid fears the status of a disease. Unlike an anxiety attack, a phobia focuses on a specific object or situation. The patient is chronically fearful of a particular animal or situation and becomes extremely anxious or panic stricken and incapacitated when placed in a situation that evokes the phobia. These situations are avoided at all costs. As a result, it may be impossible for the patient to leave the house or neighborhood unaccompanied or at all, mingle in a crowd, walk across a bridge, or travel by air. This fear of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or extremely embarrassing is spoken of as agoraphobia. (Agoraphobia, however, is a secondary feature of other psychiatric disorders, the most frequent being anxiety with panic attacks as already mentioned.) The most common phobia—and one that is not disabling for the most part—is claustrophobia, the fear of being confined in a close space such as an elevator or a magnetic resonance scanner. Other phobias are those of open (agoraphobia), closed, or high places, dogs, cats, insects, dirt, sprays and other contaminants, air travel, HIV, cancer, insanity, and death. Feelings of helplessness, pessimism, and despondency, the hallmarks of a depressive illness, result after years of phobic suffering. Often there are obsessive-compulsive tendencies as well, and some patients are hypochondriacal. Phobias are essentially obsessive fears and are somehow allied with this latter category of neurosis. The present authors have observed a number of patients whose phobic (or obsessive- compulsive) states became greatly exaggerated as an endogenous depression developed. Recovery from the depression returned them to their earlier and milder phobic state. Like the pure phobic states, a state dominated by obsessions and compulsions is relatively rare, occurring in less than 5 percent of patients seeking help in a psychiatric outpatient clinic, but it can be extremely disabling. Minor compulsions (e.g., not stepping on cracks in the sidewalk), like minor phobias, are common in children, cause little or no distress, and disappear in later life. A few, such as rechecking a locked door or a gas stove, may persist throughout life. Also, certain habits and rigid, obsessional ways of thinking, stubbornness, extreme punctuality, and excessive attention to detail may be persistent but excite little attention medically unless they interfere with a diagnostic procedure or the treatment of a medical disease. Obsessive-compulsive disorder begins in adolescence or early adult years, although treatment may not be sought until middle age. The 2 sexes are equally affected. The onset is usually gradual and often cannot be accurately dated, but in some cases it is precipitated by a particular event in the patient’s life, such as the death of a relative. The family history often discloses a high incidence of obsessional or phobic personality in other members. There is usually a prevailing undercurrent of insecurity and anxiety. Obsessions are defined as imperative and distressing thoughts and impulses that persist in the patient’s mind despite a desire to resist and to get rid of them. They take various forms; the most common are intellectual obsessions, in which phrases, rhymes, ideas, or vivid images (these are often absurd, blasphemous, obscene, and sometimes frightening) constantly intrude into consciousness; impulsive obsessions, in which the mind is dominated by an impulse to kill oneself, to stab one’s children, or to perform some other objectionable act; and inhibiting obsessions, in which every act must be ruminated upon and analyzed before it is carried out—a state that is cleverly called doubting mania. Every effort at distraction fails to rid the patient of the obsessive thought. It engulfs the individual’s mind, rendering the person dysphoric and, often, inefficient. Probably the most disturbing obsessions are the impulsive ones, in which patients constantly struggle with the fear that they will put some terrible thought into action. Even as they tell of the obsession, they reveal a severe underlying anxiety and seek reassurance that they will not yield to it. Fortunately, such patients rarely obey their pathologic impulses. Phobias, as mentioned earlier, are considered by some authorities to be essentially obsessive fears and are included in this category of neurosis. Compulsions are acts that result from obsessions. These are single acts or a series of acts (rituals) that the patient must carry out in order to put his mind at ease. Examples are repeated checking of the gas jets or the locks on doors, adjusting articles of clothing, repeated hand washing, using a clean handkerchief to wipe objects that have been touched by others, tasting foods in specific ways, and touching or arranging objects in a particular sequence. The most common of these obsessions and compulsions center around contamination concerns that lead to repeated hand washing or bathing. Other obsessions and compulsions can be identified as clusters of thoughts that derive from the above-mentioned concern about harm to oneself or to others and consequent checking on others. Less common clusters involve excessive focus on symmetry, precision, and ordering, and on saving and hoarding. Certain motor disturbances—namely, habit spasms or tics—are, in a sense, motor compulsions. They consist of repetitious movements of the shoulders, arms, hands, and certain of the facial muscles (see Chap. 4). One feature that separates quasivoluntary tics from involuntary movements of extrapyramidal type is the patient’s feeling that the tics must be carried out to relieve an inner tension. Unlike compulsions, however, tics are not usually based directly on obsessive thoughts—except perhaps the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, in which multiple tics are combined with compulsive utterances, often offensive ones (see later). In all these obsessions and compulsions and in the phobias, patients recognize the irrationality of their ideas and behaviors, yet are powerless to control them. It is this insight into the obsessional experience and the struggle against it that distinguish obsessions from delusions. After the condition has persisted for a time, they may become depressed and suffer from typical anxiety attacks. Mechanisms of Obsessive Disorder\n\n\n\nFor many years, a number of psychodynamic conceptualizations held sway of obsessional states as the product of intrapsychic conflicts. Only relatively recently has a more reasonable neurobiologic model been advanced. These are largely derived from the findings of functional imaging, which have been quite consistent in demonstrating increased metabolic activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate, and, to a lesser extent, striatum. The orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala were reported to be shrunken in other cases. In a study of 13 patients who developed elements of obsessiveness and compulsive disorder after incurring focal brain lesions, Berthier and colleagues found lesions in diverse loci, including the cingulate, frontal, and temporal cortices, as well as the basal ganglia. Two of the most accurately localized lesions in their series were a hamartoma of the right parahippocampal gyrus and an infarction in the posterior putamen. The presence of brain injuries and seizure disorders in other of their patients made precise localization less certain. Additional insight into obsessive-compulsive disorder may be obtained from the many cases in which acquired striatal damage may be linked to obsessional behavior. One such entity is a poststreptococcal tic disorder termed PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections), discussed in Chap. 4. This disorder is presumably related to another extrapyramidal condition, Sydenham chorea, in which tics and similar movement disorders, as well as obsessive behavioral abnormalities, have long been known to coexist. Functional imaging studies in patients with\n\n\n\nPANDAS have yielded variable findings but generally there has been increased activity in the caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex in association with the patient’s compulsive thoughts. The Gilles de la Tourette syndrome of multiple tics, including vocal ones, beginning in childhood or adolescence and lasting more than a year, has a strong component of obsessive-compulsive disorder in more than half of patients. Both disorders occur in a pattern of inheritance that is close to an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance (Kurlan). Because dopamine antagonists (Haldol was the first of these to be tried systematically, by Shapiro) have been beneficial in the management of the Tourette syndrome, a number of etiologic hypotheses revolve around serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems (Baxter). The neurochemical alterations in obsessive-compulsive disorder have been based in part on the responses to medications, notably to the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as noted further on. These agents are found to be of therapeutic benefit, as are stereotactic neurosurgical lesions in the cingulate gyri (see further on). More extensive comments on the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome are found in Chap. 4.', '|CD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for ""other substance"" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un- known, the category ”unknown substance” should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in- toxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). Unlike the record- ing procedures for ICD-lO-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD—9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring dur- ing withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 loraz- epam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each should be listed sep- arately (e.g., 292.89 methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxica- tion; 292.89 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use). |CD-10-CM.

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, Which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for ”other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.

For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use dis- order, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid se- vere lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.980 psilocybin—induced anxi- ety disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each should be listed sep- arately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate—induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety dis- order, with onset after medication use). The essential features of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are prominent symptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the effects of a sub- stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure). The panic or anxiety symp- after exposure to a medication, and the substances or medications must be capable of pro— ducing the symptoms (Criterion B2). Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if a withdrawal is associated with the medication). Once the treatment is discontinued, the panic or anxiety symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several weeks to a month (depending on the half-life of the substance/ medication and the presence of with- drawal). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should not be given if the onset of the panic or anxiety symptoms precedes the substance/ medication in- toxication or withdrawal, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (i.e., usually longer than 1 month) from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for substantial periods of time, other causes for the symptoms should be considered. The substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made in- stead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Panic or anxiety can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of sub- stances: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, inhalants, stimu— lants (including cocaine), and other (or unknown) substances. Panic or anxiety can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sed- atives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) substances. Some medications that evoke anxiety symptoms include anesthetics and anal- gesics, sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators, anticholinergics, insulin, thyroid prep- arations, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medications, corticosteroids, antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, an- tipsychotic medications, and antidepressant medications. Heavy metals and toxins (e.g., organophosphate insecticide, nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile sub- stances such as gasoline and paint) may also cause panic or anxiety symptoms. The prevalence of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is not clear. General population data suggest that it may be rare, with a 12-month prevalence of approximately 0.002%. However, in clinical populations, the prevalence is likely to be higher. Laboratory assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance intox- ication as part of an assessment for substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. Anxiety symptoms commonly oc- cur in substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance— specific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should be made in addition to substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the panic or anxiety symptoms are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently se- vere to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal. Anxiety disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance/medication). Substance/medication- induced anxiety disorder is judged to be etiologically related to the substance/medication. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from a primary anxiety disorder based on the onset, course, and other factors with respect to substances/medica- tions. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings for use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorders arise only in association with intoxication or withdrawal states, whereas primary anxiety disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The pres- ence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder, such as atypical age at onset (e.g., onset of panic disorder after age 45 years) or symptoms (e.g., atypical panic attack symptoms such as true vertigo, loss of balance, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder con- trol, headaches, slurred speech) may suggest a substance/medication-induced etiology. A primary anxiety disorder diagnosis is warranted if the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance in- toxication or acute withdrawal or there is a history of an anxiety disorder. Delirium. If panic or anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of delirium, they are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed sep- arately. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. If the panic or anxiety symptoms are attributed to the physiological consequences of another medical condition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for the medical condition), anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., med- ication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether the medica- tion is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety symp- toms are attributable to a substance/medication or to another medical condition or are pri- mary (i.e., not attributable to either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder would be indicated. Diagnostic Criteria 293.84 (F06.4)\n\n\n\nA. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture. B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the dis- turbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition. C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder. D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social. occupa- tional, or other important areas of functioning. Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition within the name of the men- tal disorder (e.g.. 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the anxiety disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 [D3500] pheochromocytoma; 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma. The essential feature of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is clinically signifi- cant anxiety that is judged to be best explained as a physiological effect of another medical con- dition. Symptoms can include prominent anxiety symptoms or panic attacks (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated physical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion\n\n\n\nB). Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, in particular, adjustment disorder, with anxiety, in which the stressor is the medical condition (Criterion C). In this case, an individual with adjustment disorder is espe- cially distressed about the meaning or the consequences of the associated medical condition. By contrast, there is often a prominent physical component to the anxiety (e.g., shortness of breath) when the anxiety is due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is not made if the anxiety symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The anxiety symp- toms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E). In determining whether the anxiety symptoms are attributable to another medical con- dition, the clinician must first establish the presence of the medical condition. Further- more, it must be established that anxiety symptoms can be etiologically related to the is the best explanation for the symptoms in a specific individual. A careful and compre-\n\n\n\nAnxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 231 hensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Several aspects of the clinical presentation should be considered: 1) the presence of a clear temporal asso- ciation between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the anx- iety symptoms; 2) the presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and 3) evidence in the literature that a known phys- iological mechanism (e.g., hyperthyroidism) causes anxiety. In addition, the disturbance must not be better explained by a primary anxiety disorder, a substance/medication- induced anxiety disorder, or another primary mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder). A number of medical conditions are known to include anxiety as a symptomatic manifes- tation. Examples include endocrine disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, hyperadrenocortisolism), cardiovascular disorders (e.g., congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation), respiratory illness (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumonia), metabolic distur— bances (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency, porphyria), and neurological illness (e.g., neoplasms, vestibular dysfunction, encephalitis, seizure disorders). Anxiety due to another medical condition is diagnosed when the medical condition is known to induce anxiety and when the medical condition preceded the onset of the anxiety. The prevalence of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is unclear. There ap- pears to be an elevated prevalence of anxiety disorders among individuals with a variety of medical conditions, including asthma, hypertension, ulcers, and arthritis. However, this increased prevalence may be due to reasons other than the anxiety disorder directly caus- ing the medical condition. The development and course of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition gen- erally follows the course of the underlying illness. This diagnosis is not meant to include primary anxiety disorders that arise in the context of chronic medical illness. This is im- portant to consider with older adults, who may experience chronic medical illness and then develop independent anxiety disorders secondary to the chronic medical illness. Laboratory assessments and/ or medical examinations are necessary to confirm the diag- nosis of the associated medical condition. Delirium. A separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of anxiety is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder and if anxiety is a prominent part of the clinical presentation. Mixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and anxiety). If the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. If there is evidence of recent or pro- longed substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should be considered. Certain medications are known to increase anxiety (e.g., corticoste- roids, estrogens, metoclopramide), and when this is the case, the medication may be the most likely etiology, although it may be difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is at- tributable to the medications or to the medical illness itself. When a diagnosis of substance- induced anxiety is being made in relation to recreational or nonprescribed drugs, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance/ medi- cation-induced anxiety disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the sub- stance used. If the disturbance is associated with both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) can be given. Features such as onset af- ter age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic at- tack symptoms.

The doses are similar to those used to treat depression, and small differences between them do not seem to be clinically important (see Chap. 48).

","['In: Morse SA, Moreland AA, Thompson SE, eds. Atlas of sexually transmitted diseases. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott, 1990.)\n\n\n\nGenital Ulcer Disease In the United States, most patients with genital ulcers have genital HSV or syphilis (47–50). Chancroid is the next most common cause of sexually transmitted genital ulcers, followed by the rare occurrence of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and granuloma inguinale (donovanosis). These diseases are associated with an increased risk for HIV infection. Other infrequent and noninfectious causes of genital ulcers include abrasions, fixed drug eruptions, carcinoma, and Behcet’s disease. Diagnosis A diagnosis based on history and physical examination alone is often inaccurate. Therefore, all women with genital ulcers should undergo a serologic test for syphilis (50). Because of the consequences of inappropriate therapy, such as tertiary disease and congenital syphilis in pregnant women, diagnostic efforts are directed at excluding syphilis. Optimally, the evaluation of a patient with a genital ulcer should include dark-field examination or direct immunoﬂuorescence testing for Treponema pallidum, culture or antigen testing for HSV, and culture for Haemophilus ducreyi. Dark-field or ﬂuorescent microscopes and selective media to culture for H. ducreyi often are not available in most offices and clinics. Even after complete testing, the diagnosis remains unconfirmed in one-fourth of patients with genital ulcers. For this reason, most clinicians base their initial diagnosis and treatment recommendations on their clinical impression of the appearance of the genital ulcer (Fig. 18.2) and knowledge of the most likely cause in their patient population (48). Several clinical presentations are highly suggestive of specific diagnoses: 1. A painless and minimally tender ulcer, not accompanied by inguinal lymphadenopathy, is likely to be syphilis, especially if the ulcer is indurated. A nontreponemal rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, or venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, and a confirmatory treponemal test—ﬂuorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA ABS) or microhemagglutinin–T. pallidum (MHA TP)—should be used to diagnose syphilis presumptively. Some laboratories screen samples with treponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA) tests, the results of which should be confirmed with nontreponemal tests. The results of nontreponemal tests usually correlate with disease activity and should be reported quantitatively. 2. Grouped vesicles mixed with small ulcers, particularly with a history of such lesions, are almost always pathognomonic of genital herpes. Nevertheless, laboratory confirmation of the findings is recommended because the diagnosis of genital herpes is traumatic for many women, alters their self-image, and affects their perceived ability to enter new sexual relationships and bear children. A culture test is the most sensitive and specific test; sensitivity approaches 100% in the vesicle stage and 89% in the pustular stage and drops to as low as 33% in patients with ulcers. Nonculture tests are about 80% as sensitive as culture tests. Because false-negative results are common with HSV cultures, especially in patients with recurrent infections, type-specific glycoprotein G-based antibody assays are useful in confirming a clinical diagnosis of genital herpes. 3. One to three extremely painful ulcers, accompanied by tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, are unlikely to be anything except chancroid. This is especially true if the adenopathy is ﬂuctuant. 4. An inguinal bubo accompanied by one or several ulcers is most likely chancroid. If no ulcer is present, the most likely diagnosis is LGV. Recommended regimens for the treatment of chancroid include azithromycin, 1 g orally in a single dose; ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly in a single dose; ciproﬂoxacin, 500 mg orally twice a day for 3 days; or erythromycin base, 500 mg orally four times daily for 7 days. Patients should be reexamined 3 to 7 days after initiation of therapy to ensure the gradual resolution of the genital ulcer, which can be expected to heal within 2 weeks unless it is unusually large. A first episode of genital herpes should be treated with acyclovir, 400 mg orally three times a day; or famciclovir, 250 mg orally three times a day; or valacyclovir, 1.0 orally twice a day for 7 to 10 days or until clinical resolution is attained. Although these agents provide partial control of the symptoms and signs of clinical herpes, it neither eradicates latent virus nor affects subsequent risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after the drug is discontinued. Daily suppressive therapy (acyclovir, 400 mg orally twice daily; or famciclovir, 250 mg twice daily; or valacyclovir, 1.0 g orally once a day) reduces the frequency of HSV recurrences by at least 75% among patients with six or more recurrences of HSV per year. Suppressive treatment partially, but not totally, decreases symptomatic and asymptomatic viral shedding and the potential for transmission (49). Parenteral administration of penicillin G is the preferred treatment of all stages of syphilis. Benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million units intramuscularly in a single dose, is the recommended treatment for adults with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction—an acute febrile response accompanied by headache, myalgia, and other symptoms— may occur within the first 24 hours after any therapy for syphilis; patients should be advised of this possible adverse reaction.

Latent syphilis is defined as those periods after infection with T. pallidum when patients are seroreactive but show no other evidence of disease. Patients with latent syphilis of longer than 1 year’s duration or of unknown duration should be treated with benzathine penicillin G, 7.2 million units total, administered as three doses of 2.4 million units intramuscularly each, at 1-week intervals. All patients with latent syphilis should be evaluated clinically for evidence of tertiary disease (e.g., aortitis, neurosyphilis, gumma, and iritis). Quantitative nontreponemal serologic tests should be repeated at 6 months and again at 12 months. An initially high titer (1:32) should decline at least fourfold (two dilutions) within 12 to 24 months. Genital Warts External genital warts are a manifestation of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (51). The nononcogenic HPV types 6 and 11 are usually responsible for external genital warts. The warts tend to occur in areas most directly affected by coitus, namely the posterior fourchette and lateral areas on the vulva. Less frequently, warts can be found throughout the vulva, in the vagina, and on the cervix. Minor trauma associated with coitus can cause breaks in the vulvar skin, allowing direct contact between the viral particles from an infected man and the basal layer of the epidermis of his susceptible sexual partner. Infection may be latent or may cause viral particles to replicate and produce a wart. External genital warts are highly contagious; more than 75% of sexual partners develop this manifestation of HPV infection when exposed. The goal of treatment is removal of the warts; it is not possible to eradicate the viral infection. Treatment is most successful in patients with small warts that were present for less than 1 year. It is not determined whether treatment of genital warts reduces transmission of HPV. Selection of a specific treatment regimen depends on the anatomic site, size, and number of warts, and expense, efficacy, convenience, and potential adverse effects (Table 18.6). Recurrences more often result from reactivation of subclinical infection than reinfection by a sex partner; therefore, examination of sex partners is not absolutely necessary. However, many of these sex partners may have external genital warts and may benefit from therapy and counseling concerning transmission of warts. HPV infection with types 6,11, 16, and 18 can be prevented by vaccination. It is estimated that almost 40% to 50% of individuals with HIV are women. Intravenous drug use and heterosexual transmission are responsible for most of the cases of AIDS in women in the United States (52). Infection with HIV produces a spectrum of disease that progresses from an asymptomatic state to full-blown AIDS. The pace of disease progression in untreated adults is variable. The median time between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS is 10 years, with a range from a few months to more than 12 years. In a study of adults infected with HIV, symptoms developed in 70% to 85% of infected adults, and AIDS developed in 55% to 60% within 12 years after infection. The natural history of the disease can be significantly altered by antiretroviral therapy. Women with HIV-induced altered immune function are at increased risk for infections such as tuberculosis (TB), bacterial pneumonia, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). Because of its impact on the immune system, HIV affects the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of many other diseases and may decrease the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy for some STDs. Diagnosis Infection is most often diagnosed by HIV antibody tests. Antibody testing begins with a sensitive screening test such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a rapid assay. If confirmed by Western blot, a positive antibody test result confirms that a person is infected with HIV and is capable of transmitting the virus to others. HIV antibody is detectable in more than 95% of patients within 6 months of infection. Women diagnosed with any STI, particularly genital ulcer disease, should be offered HIV testing (48). Routine HIV screening is recommended for women aged 19 to 64 years and targeted screening for women with risk factors outside of that age range, for example, sexually active adolescents (53). The initial evaluation of an HIV-positive woman includes screening for diseases associated with HIV such as TB and STIs, administration of recommended vaccinations (hepatitis B, pneumococcal, meningococcal and inﬂuenza), and behavioral and psychosocial counseling. Intraepithelial neoplasia is strongly associated with HPV infection and occurs in high frequency in women with both HPV and HIV. Treatment Decisions regarding the initiation of antiretroviral therapy should be guided by monitoring the laboratory parameters of HIV RNA (viral load) and CD4+ T-cell count, and the clinical condition of the patient. The primary goals of antiretroviral therapy are maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration or preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality, and prevention of HIV transmission. Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated in all women with a history of an AIDS-defining illness or with a CD4 count less than 350 cells per mm3 . Antiretroviral treatment should be started regardless of CD4 count in women with the following conditions: pregnancy, HIV-associated nephropathy, and hepatitis B coinfection when treatment of hepatitis B is indicated. Patients must be willing to accept therapy to avoid the emergence of resistance caused by poor compliance. Dual nucleoside regimens used in addition to a protease inhibitor or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor provide a better durable clinical benefit than monotherapy. Patients with less than 200 CD4+ T cells per μL should receive prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or aerosol pentamidine for the prevention of PCP pneumonia. Those with less than 50 CD4+ T cells per uL should receive azithromycin prophylaxis for mycobacterial infections (54). Acute Cystitis Women with acute cystitis generally have an abrupt onset of multiple, severe urinary tract symptoms including dysuria, frequency, and urgency associated with suprapubic or low-back pain. Suprapubic tenderness may be noted on physical examination. Urinalysis reveals pyuria and sometimes hematuria. Several factors increase the risk for cystitis, including sexual intercourse, the use of a diaphragm and a spermicide, delayed postcoital micturition, and a history of a recent urinary tract infection (55–57). Diagnosis Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen isolated from the urine of young women with acute cystitis, and it is present in 80% of cases (58). Staphylococcus saprophyticus is present in an additional 5% to 15% of patients with cystitis. The pathophysiology of cystitis in women involves the colonization of the vagina and urethra with coliform bacteria from the rectum. For this reason, the effects of an antimicrobial agent on the vaginal ﬂora play a role in the eradication of bacteriuria. Treatment High concentrations of trimethoprim and ﬂuoroquinolone in vaginal secretions can eradicate E. coli while minimally altering normal anaerobic and microaerophilic vaginal ﬂora. An increasing linear trend in the prevalence of resistance of E. coli (>10%) to the ﬂuoroquinolones (e.g., ciproﬂoxacin) was noted. Despite a similar increase in E. coli resistance (9%–18%) to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, therapeutic efficacy remains stable. In contrast, no such increase in resistance was noted with nitrofurantoin. Nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals, 100 mg orally twice daily for 5 days) or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg orally twice daily for 3 days) are the optimal choices for empirical therapy for uncomplicated cystitis (59). In patients with typical symptoms, an abbreviated laboratory workup followed by empirical therapy is suggested. The diagnosis can be presumed if pyuria is detected by microscopy or leukocyte esterase testing. Urine culture is not necessary, and a short course of antimicrobial therapy should be given. No follow-up visit or culture is necessary unless symptoms persist or recur. Recurrent Cystitis About 20% of premenopausal women with an initial episode of cystitis have recurrent infections. More than 90% of these recurrences are caused by exogenous reinfection. Recurrent cystitis should be documented by culture to rule out resistant micro-organisms. Patients may be treated by one of three strategies: (i) continuous prophylaxis, (ii) postcoital prophylaxis, or (iii) therapy initiated by the patient when symptoms are first noted. Postmenopausal women may have frequent reinfections. Hormonal therapy or topically applied estrogen cream, along with antimicrobial prophylaxis, is helpful in treating these patients. Urethritis Women with dysuria caused by urethritis have a more gradual onset of mild symptoms, which may be associated with abnormal vaginal discharge or bleeding related to concurrent cervicitis. Patients may have a new sex partner or experience lower abdominal pain. Physical examination may reveal the presence of mucopurulent cervicitis or vulvovaginal herpetic lesions. C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or genital herpes may cause acute urethritis. Pyuria is present on urinalysis, but hematuria is rarely seen. Treatment regimens for chlamydia and gonococcal infections are presented in Table 18.3. Occasionally, vaginitis caused by C. albicans or trichomonas is associated with dysuria. On careful questioning, patients generally describe external dysuria, sometimes associated with vaginal discharge, and pruritus and dyspareunia. They usually do not experience urgency or frequency. Pyuria and hematuria are absent. Acute Pyelonephritis The clinical spectrum of acute, uncomplicated pyelonephritis in young women ranges from gram-negative septicemia to a cystitislike illness with mild ﬂank pain. E. coli accounts for more than 80% of these cases (58). Microscopy of unspun urine reveals pyuria and gram-negative bacteria. A urine culture should be obtained in all women with suspected pyelonephritis; blood cultures should be performed in those who are hospitalized because results are positive in 15% to 20% of cases. In the absence of nausea and vomiting and severe illness, outpatient oral therapy can be given safely. Patients who have nausea and vomiting, are moderately to severely ill, or are pregnant should be hospitalized. Outpatient treatment regimens include trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg every 12 hours for 14 days) or a quinolone (e.g., levoﬂoxacin, 750 mg daily for 7 days). Inpatient treatment regimens include the use of parenteral levoﬂoxacin (750 mg daily), ceftriaxone (1–2 g daily), ampicillin (1 g every 6 hours), and gentamicin (especially if Enterococcus species are suspected) or aztreonam (1 g every 8–12 hours). Symptoms should resolve after 48 to 72 hours. If fever and ﬂank pain persist after 72 hours of therapy, ultrasound or computed tomography should be considered to rule out a perinephric or intrarenal abscess or ureteral obstruction. A follow-up culture should be obtained 2 weeks after the completion of therapy (60). 1.', 'A. Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the inguinal lymphatics and lymph nodes\n\n\n\nB.

She gains consciousness, but her blood pressure is unchanged. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the hypotension?
A:Infection involving the suture line

","['lowering of the pressure may cause secondary ischemia and possibly infarction as pressure drops below the lower range of the patient’s autoregulatory capability. In cases where there is an identified cause of the syndrome, these etiologies should be treated promptly, including discontinuation of offending substances such as calcineurin inhibitors in toxic processes, treatment of immune-mediated disorders such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and prompt delivery of the fetus in eclampsia. Seizures must be identified and controlled, often necessitating continuous EEG monitoring. Anticonvulsants are effective when seizure activity is identified, but in the special case of eclampsia, there is evidence to support the use of magnesium sulfate for seizure control. Central nervous system (CNS) injuries following open heart or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery are common and include acute encephalopathy, stroke, and a chronic syndrome of cognitive impairment. Hypoperfusion and embolic disease are frequently involved in the pathogenesis of these syndromes, although multiple mechanisms may be involved in these critically ill patients who are at risk for various metabolic and polypharmaceutical complications. The frequency of hypoxic injury secondary to inadequate blood flow intraoperatively has been markedly decreased by the use of modern surgical and anesthetic techniques. Despite these advances, some patients still experience neurologic complications from cerebral hypoperfusion or may suffer focal ischemia from carotid or focal intra-cranial stenoses in the setting of regional hypoperfusion. Postoperative infarcts in the border zones between vascular territories commonly are blamed on systemic hypotension, although these infarcts can also result from embolic disease (Fig. 463e-2). Embolic disease is likely the predominant mechanism of cerebral injury during cardiac surgery as evidenced by diffusion-weighted MRI and intraoperative transcranial Doppler studies. It should be noted that some of the emboli that are found histologically in these\n\n\n\nFIGURE 463e-2 Coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in a patient presenting with altered mental status after an episode of hypotension during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Increased signal is seen in the border zones bilaterally between the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery territories. Diffusion-weighted MRI sequences demonstrated restricted diffusion in these same locations, suggesting acute infarction. patients are too small to be detected by standard imaging sequences; therefore, a negative MRI after surgery does not exclude the diagnosis of emboli-related complications. Thrombus in the heart itself as well as atheromas in the aortic arch can become dislodged during cardiac surgeries, releasing a shower of particulate matter into the cerebral circulation. Cross-clamping of the aorta, manipulation of the heart, extracorporeal circulation techniques (“bypass”), arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, and introduction of air through suctioning have all been implicated as potential sources of emboli. Histologic studies indicate that literally millions of tiny emboli may be released, even using modern surgical techniques. This shower of microemboli results in a number of clinical syndromes. Occasionally, a single large embolus leads to an isolated large-vessel stroke that presents with obvious clinical focal deficits. More commonly, the emboli released are multiple and smaller. When there is a high burden of these small emboli, an acute encephalopathy can occur postoperatively, presenting as either a hyperactive or hypoactive confusional state, the latter of which is frequently and incorrectly ascribed to depression or a sedative-induced delirium. When the burden of microemboli is lower, no acute syndrome is recognized, but the patient may suffer a chronic cognitive deficit. Cardiac surgery can be viewed, like delirium, as a “stress test for the brain.” Some patients with a low cerebral reserve due to underlying cerebrovascular disease or an early neurodegenerative process will develop a chronic, cognitive deficit, whereas others with higher reserves may remain asymptomatic despite a similar dose of microemboli. In this manner, cardiac surgery may serve to unmask the early manifestations of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Since modern techniques have successfully minimized hypoperfusion complications during these surgeries, much attention is now focused on reducing this inevitable shower of microemboli. Off-pump CABG surgeries have the advantages of reducing length of stay and perioperative complications; however, off-pump CABG probably does not preserve cognitive function compared with on-pump CABG. Filters placed in the aortic arch may have some promise in capturing these emboli, although convincing evidence is lacking. Development of successful endovascular operative approaches may provide a reasonable alternative to conventional CABG procedures, especially for patients at high risk of developing cognitive dysfunction after surgery due to advanced age, previous stroke, underlying neurodegenerative disorders, or severe atheromatous disease of the carotid arteries or aortic arch. Patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation are at risk for neurologic injury in the postoperative period and for months to years thereafter. Neurologic consultants should view these patients as a special population at risk for both unique neurologic complications as well as for the usual disorders found in any critically ill inpatient. Immunosuppressive medications are administered in high doses to patients after solid organ transplant, and many of these compounds have well-described neurologic complications. In patients with headache, seizures, or focal neurologic deficits taking calcineurin inhibitors, the diagnosis of hyperperfusion syndrome should be considered, as discussed above. This neurotoxicity occurs mainly with cyclosporine and tacrolimus and can present even in the setting of normal serum drug levels. Treatment primarily involves lowering the drug dosage or discontinuing the drug. Sirolimus has very few recorded cases of neurotoxicity and may be a reasonable alternative for some patients. Other examples of immunosuppressive medications and their neurologic complications include OKT3-associated akinetic mutism and the leukoencephalopathy seen with methotrexate, especially when it is administered intrathecally or with concurrent radiotherapy. In any solid organ transplant patient with neurologic complaints, a careful examination of the medication list is required to search for these possible drug effects. Cerebrovascular complications of solid organ transplant are often first recognized in the immediate postoperative period. Border zone territory infarctions can occur, especially in the setting of systemic hypotension during cardiac transplant surgery. Embolic infarctions classically complicate cardiac transplantation, but all solid organ transplant procedures place patients at risk for systemic emboli. When cerebral embolization accompanies renal or liver transplantation surgery, a careful search for right-to-left shunting should include evaluation of the heart with agitated saline echocardiography (i.e., “bubble study”), as well as looking for intrapulmonary shunting. Renal and some cardiac transplant patients often have advanced atherosclerosis, providing yet another mechanism for stroke. Imaging with CT or MRI with diffusion is advised when cerebrovascular complications are suspected to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage, which most often occurs in the setting of coagulopathy secondary to liver failure or after cardiac bypass procedures. Given that patients with solid organ transplants are chronically immunosuppressed, infections are a common concern (Chap. 169). In any transplant patient with new CNS signs or symptoms such as seizure, confusion, or focal deficit, the diagnosis of a CNS infection should be considered and evaluated through imaging (usually MRI) and possibly lumbar puncture. The most common pathogens responsible for CNS infections in these patients vary based on time since transplant. In the first month posttransplant, common pathogens include the usual bacterial organisms associated with surgical procedures and indwelling catheters. Starting in the second month posttransplant, opportunistic infections of the CNS become more common, including Nocardia and Toxoplasma species as well as fungal infections such as aspergillosis. Viral infections that can affect the brain of the immunosuppressed patient, such as herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), and varicella, also become more common after the first month posttransplant. After 6 months posttransplant, immunosuppressed patients still remain at risk for these opportunistic bacterial, fungal, and viral infections but can also suffer late CNS infectious complications such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) associated with JC virus and Epstein-Barr virus–driven clonal expansions of B cells resulting in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder or CNS lymphoma. A wide variety of neurologic conditions can result from abnormalities in serum electrolytes, and consideration of electrolyte disturbances should be part of any inpatient neurologic consultation. A complete general discussion of fluid and electrolyte imbalance and homeostasis can be found in Chap. 63. The normal range of serum osmolality is around 275–295 mOsm/kg, but neurologic manifestations are usually seen only at levels >325 mOsm/kg. Hyperosmolality is usually due to hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, azotemia, or the addition of extrinsic osmoles such as mannitol, which is commonly used in critically ill neurologic patients. Hyperosmolality itself can lead to a generalized encephalopathy that is nonspecific and without focal findings; however, an underlying lesion such as a mass can become symptomatic under the metabolic stress of a hyperosmolar state, producing focal neurologic signs. Some patients with hyperosmolality from severe hyperglycemia can present, for unclear reasons, with generalized seizures or unilateral movement disorders, which usually respond to lowering of the serum glucose. The treatment of all forms of hyperosmolality involves calculation of apparent water losses and slow replacement so that the serum sodium declines no faster than 2 mmol/L (2 meq/L) per hour. Hypernatremia leads to the loss of intracellular water, leading to cell shrinkage. In the cells of the brain, solutes such as glutamine and urea are generated under these conditions in order to minimize this shrinkage. Despite this corrective mechanism, when hypernatremia is severe (serum sodium >160 mmol/L [>160 meq/L]) or occurs rapidly, cellular metabolic processes fail and encephalopathy will result. There are many etiologies of hypernatremia including, most commonly, renal and extrarenal losses of water. Causes of neurologic relevance include central diabetes insipidus, where hyperosmolality is accompanied by submaximal urinary concentration due to inadequate release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) from the posterior pituitary, resulting often from pituitary injury in the setting of surgery, hemorrhage, infiltrative processes, or cerebral herniation. Hyponatremia is commonly defined as a serum sodium <135 mmol/L (<135 meq/L). Neurologic symptoms occur at different levels of low sodium, depending not only on the absolute value but also on the rate of fall. In patients with hyponatremia that develops over hours, life-threatening seizures and cerebral edema may occur at values as high as 125 mmol/L. In contrast, some patients with more chronic hyponatremia that has slowly developed over months to years may be asymptomatic even with serum levels <110 mmol/L. Correction of hyponatremia, especially when chronic, must take place slowly in order to avoid additional neurologic complications. Cells in the brain swell in hypotonic hyponatremic states but may compensate over time by excreting solute into the extracellular space, leading to restoration of cell volume when water follows the solute out of the cells. If treatment of hyponatremia results in a rapid rise in serum sodium, cells in the brain may quickly shrink, leading to osmotic demyelination, a process that previously was thought to be limited exclusively to the brainstem (central pontine myelinolysis; see Fig. 330-6), but now has been described elsewhere in the CNS.', '324. Shock, a common condition necessitating ICU admission or occurring in the course of critical care, is defined by the presence of multisystem end-organ hypoperfusion. Clinical indicators include reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP), tachycardia, tachypnea, cool skin and extremities, acute altered mental status, and oliguria. Hypotension is usually, though not always, present. The end result of multiorgan hypoperfusion is tissue hypoxia, often with accompanying lactic acidosis. Since the MAP is the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), reductions in blood pressure can be caused by decreases in cardiac output and/or SVR. Accordingly, once shock is contemplated, the initial evaluation of a hypotensive patient should include an early bedside assessment of the adequacy of cardiac output (Fig. 321-2). Clinical evidence of diminished cardiac output includes a narrow pulse pressure—a marker that correlates with stroke volume— and cool extremities with delayed capillary refill. Signs of increased cardiac output include a widened pulse pressure (particularly with a reduced diastolic pressure), warm extremities with bounding pulses, and rapid capillary refill. If a hypotensive patient has clinical signs of increased cardiac output, it can be inferred that the reduced blood pressure is from decreased SVR. In hypotensive patients with signs of reduced cardiac output, an assessment of intravascular volume status is appropriate. A hypotensive patient with decreased intravascular volume status may have a history suggesting hemorrhage or other volume losses (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria). Although evidence of a reduced jugular venous pressure (JVP) is often sought, static measures of right atrial pressure do not predict fluid responsiveness reliably; the change in right atrial pressure as a function of spontaneous respiration is a better predictor of fluid responsiveness (Fig. 321-3). Patients with fluid-responsive (i.e., hypovolemic) shock also may manifest large changes in pulse pressure as a function of respiration during mechanical ventilation (Fig. 321-4). A hypotensive patient with increased intravascular volume and cardiac dysfunction may have S3 and/or S4 gallops on examination, increased JVP, extremity edema, and crackles on lung auscultation. The chest x-ray may show cardiomegaly, widening of the vascular pedicle, Kerley B lines, and pulmonary edema. Chest pain and electrocardiographic changes consistent with ischemia may be noted (Chap. 326). In hypotensive patients with clinical evidence of increased cardiac output, a search for causes of decreased SVR is appropriate.

About 48 h after these patients had recovered from anesthesia, their serum Na fell markedly, at which point generalized seizures occurred, followed by respiratory arrest. We are more familiar with acutely developing hyponatremia in the context of prostate surgery, where large amounts of hypotonic fluids are routinely administered both intravenously and intravascularly. A similar syndrome is known in instances of overly zealous fluid resuscitation in children with diabetic ketoacidosis. The mechanisms of neurologic deterioration in all of these cases is likely to be brain edema.', 'If CO2 embolus is suspected or diagnosed, the surgeon must evacuate the CO2 from the peritoneal cavity and place the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, with the head below the level of the right atrium.

","['meningitidis). Similarly, patients who are antibody-deficient (e.g., those with CLL, those who have received intensive chemotherapy, or those who have undergone bone marrow transplantation) are likely to have infections caused by these bacteria. Other cancer patients, however, because of their defective cellular immunity, are likely to be infected with other pathogens (Table 104-3). Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis should be considered, especially in patients from countries where tuberculosis is highly prevalent in the population. Encephalitis The spectrum of disease resulting from viral encephalitis is expanded in immunocompromised patients. A predisposition to infections with intracellular organisms similar to those encountered in patients with AIDS (Chap. 226) is seen in cancer patients receiving (1) high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy, (2) chemotherapy affecting T cell function (e.g., fludarabine), or (3) antibodies that eliminate T cells (e.g., anti-CD3, alemtuzumab, anti-CD52) or cytokine activity (anti– tumor necrosis factor agents or interleukin 1 receptor antagonists). Infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) has been associated with encephalitis that may be caused by VZV-related vasculitis. Chronic viral infections may also be associated with dementia and encephalitic presentations. A diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Chap. 164) should be considered when a patient who has received chemotherapy (rituximab in particular) presents with dementia (Table 104-6). Other abnormalities of the CNS that may be confused with infection include normal-pressure hydrocephalus and vasculitis resulting from CNS irradiation. It may be possible to differentiate these conditions by MRI. Brain Masses Mass lesions of the brain most often present as headache with or without fever or neurologic abnormalities.

Molecular Mechanisms of Microbial Pathogenesis Gerald B. Pier Over the past four decades, molecular studies of the pathogenesis of microorganisms have yielded an explosion of information about the 145e various microbial and host molecules that contribute to the processes of infection and disease. These processes can be classified into several stages: microbial encounter with and entry into the host; microbial growth after entry; avoidance of innate host defenses; tissue invasion and tropism; tissue damage; and transmission to new hosts. Virulence is the measure of an organism’s capacity to cause disease and is a function of the pathogenic factors elaborated by microbes. These factors promote colonization (the simple presence of potentially pathogenic microbes in or on a host), infection (attachment and growth of pathogens and avoidance of host defenses), and disease (often, but not always, the result of activities of secreted toxins or toxic metabolites). In addition, the host’s inflammatory response to infection greatly contributes to disease and its attendant clinical signs and symptoms. The recent surge of interest in the role of the microbiota and its associated microbiome—the collection of microbial genomes residing in or on mammalian organisms—in the physiology of, susceptibility to, and response to infection and in immune system development has had an enormous impact on our understanding of host-pathogen interaction. (See also Chap. 86e) We now understand that the indigenous microbial organisms living in close association with almost all animals are organized into complex communities that strongly modulate the ability of pathogenic microbes to become established in or on host surfaces. The sheer numbers of these microbes and their genomic variability vastly exceed the numbers of host cells and genes in a typical animal. Changes and differences in microbiomes within and between individuals, currently characterized by high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques and bioinformatic analysis, affect the development and control of the immune system as well as such diverse conditions as obesity, type 1 diabetes, cognition, neurologic states, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and vagina. It has been more difficult to directly associate specific types of microbiomes with pathophysiologic states and to assess how conserved or variable microbial species within human and animal microbiomes are evolving. Defining clusters of organisms associated with diseases may become more feasible as more data are obtained. Complicating this task are the results from the Human Microbiome Project suggesting a high level of variability among individuals in the components of the microbiome, although many individuals appear to maintain a fairly conserved microbiome throughout their lives. In the context of infectious diseases, clear changes and disruptions of the indigenous microbiome have a strong and often fundamental impact on the progression of infection. Such alterations can be associated with the effects of antibiotic and immunosuppressive drug use on the normal flora, with environmental changes, and with the impact of microbial virulence factors that displace the indigenous microbial flora to facilitate pathogen colonization. As the available technology for defining the microbiome expands, there is no doubt that the resulting data will markedly affect our concepts of and approaches to microbial pathogenesis and infectious disease treatment. MICROBIAL ENTRY AND ADHERENCE Entry Sites A microbial pathogen can potentially enter any part of a host organism. In general, the type of disease produced by a particular microbe is often a direct consequence of its route of entry into the body. The most common sites of entry are mucosal surfaces (the respiratory, alimentary, and urogenital tracts) and the skin. Ingestion, inhalation, and sexual contact are typical routes of microbial entry. Other portals of entry include sites of skin injury (cuts, bites, burns, trauma) along with injection via natural (i.e., vector-borne) or artificial (i.e., needle-stick injury) routes. A few pathogens, such as Schistosoma 145e-1 species, can penetrate unbroken skin. The conjunctiva can serve as an entry point for pathogens of the eye, which occasionally spread systemically from that site. Microbial entry usually relies on the presence of specific factors needed for persistence and growth in a tissue. Fecal-oral spread via the alimentary tract requires a biologic profile consistent with survival in the varied environments of the gastrointestinal tract (including the low pH of the stomach and the high bile content of the intestine) as well as in contaminated food or water outside the host. Organisms that gain entry via the respiratory tract survive well in small moist droplets produced during sneezing and coughing. Pathogens that enter by venereal routes often survive best in the warm moist environment of the urogenital mucosa and have restricted host ranges (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, and HIV). The biology of microbes entering through the skin is highly varied. Some of these organisms can survive in a broad range of environments, such as the salivary glands or alimentary tracts of arthropod vectors, the mouths of larger animals, soil, and water. A complex biology allows protozoan parasites such as Plasmodium, Leishmania, and Trypanosoma species to undergo morphogenic changes that permit transmission to mammalian hosts during insect feeding for blood meals. Plasmodia are injected as infective sporozoites from the salivary glands during mosquito feeding. Leishmania parasites are regurgitated as promastigotes from the alimentary tract of sandflies and injected by bite into a susceptible host. Trypanosomes are first ingested from infected hosts by reduviid bugs; the pathogens then multiply in the gastrointestinal tract of the insects and are released in feces onto the host’s skin during subsequent feedings. Most microbes that land directly on intact skin are destined to die, as survival on the skin or in hair follicles requires resistance to fatty acids, low pH, and other antimicrobial factors on the skin. Once it is damaged (and particularly if it becomes necrotic), the skin can be a major portal of entry and growth for pathogens and elaboration of their toxic products. Burn wound infections and tetanus are clear examples. After animal bites, pathogens resident in the animal’s saliva gain access to the victim’s tissues through the damaged skin. Rabies is the paradigm for this pathogenic process; rabies virus grows in striated muscle cells at the site of inoculation. Microbial Adherence Once in or on a host, most microbes must anchor themselves to a tissue or tissue factor; the possible exceptions are organisms that directly enter the bloodstream and multiply there. Specific ligands or adhesins for host receptors constitute a major area of study in the field of microbial pathogenesis. Adhesins comprise a wide range of surface structures, not only anchoring the microbe to a tissue and promoting cellular entry where appropriate but also eliciting host responses critical to the pathogenic process (Table 145e-1). Most microbes produce multiple adhesins specific for multiple host receptors. These adhesins are often redundant, are serologically variable, and act additively or synergistically with other microbial factors to promote microbial sticking to host tissues. In addition, some microbes adsorb host proteins onto their surface and utilize the natural host protein receptor for microbial binding and entry into target cells. VIRAL ADHESINS All viral pathogens must bind to host cells, enter them, and replicate within them. Viral coat proteins serve as the ligands for cellular entry, and more than one ligand-receptor interaction may be needed; for example, HIV utilizes its envelope glycoprotein (gp) 120 to enter host cells by binding both to CD4 and to one of two receptors for chemokines (designated CCR5 and CXCR4). Similarly, the measles virus H glycoprotein binds to both CD46 and the membrane-organizing protein moesin on host cells. The gB and gC proteins on herpes simplex virus bind to heparan sulfate, although this adherence is not essential for entry but rather serves to concentrate virions close to the cell surface; this step is followed by attachment to mammalian cells mediated by the viral gD protein, with subsequent formation of a homotrimer of viral gB protein or a heterodimer of viral gH and gL proteins that permits fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. Herpes simplex virus can use a number of eukaryotic cell\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 145e Molecular Mechanisms of Microbial Pathogenesis\n\n\n\nType of Microbial Microorganism Ligand Host Receptor (SLAM) Human herpesvirus ?

Depending on the extent of reactivity, the effusion may be small, remain unnoticed, and resolve spontaneously or may be sufficiently large to cause symptoms such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical findings are those of pleural effusion: dullness to percussion and absence of breath sounds. A chest radiograph reveals the effusion and, in up to one-third of cases, also shows a parenchymal lesion. Thoracentesis is required to ascertain the nature of the effusion and to differentiate it from manifestations of other etiologies. The fluid is straw colored and at times hemorrhagic; it is an exudate with a protein concentration >50% of that in serum (usually ~4–6 g/dL), a normal to low glucose concentration, a pH of ~7.3 (occasionally <7.2), and detectable white blood cells (usually 500–6000/μL). Neutrophils may predominate in the early stage, but lymphocyte predominance is the typical finding later.', 'He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets. On examination the patient had a low-grade temperature and was tachypneic (breathing fast). There was reduced expansion of the left side of the chest. When the chest was percussed it was noted that the anterior aspect of the left chest was dull, compared to the resonant percussion note of the remainder of the chest. Auscultation (listening with a stethoscope) revealed decreased breath sounds, which were hoarse in nature (bronchial breathing). A diagnosis of chest infection was made. Chest infection is a common disease. In most patients the infection affects the large airways and bronchi. If the infection continues, exudates and transudates are produced, filling the alveoli and the secondary pulmonary lobules. The diffuse patchy nature of this type of infection is termed bronchial pneumonia. Given the patient’s specific clinical findings, bronchial pneumonia was unlikely. From the clinical findings it was clear that the patient was likely to have a pneumonia confined to a lobe. Because there are only two lobes in the left lung, the likely diagnosis was a left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest radiograph was obtained (eFig. 3.121). The posteroanterior view of the chest demonstrated an area of veil-like opacification throughout the whole of the left lung. Knowing the position of the oblique fissure, any consolidation within the left upper lobe will produce this veil-like shadowing. Lateral radiographs are usually not necessary but would demonstrate opacification anteriorly and superiorly that ends abruptly at the oblique fissure. Upper lobe pneumonias are unusual because most patients develop gravity-dependent infection. Certain infections, however, are typical within the middle and upper lobes, commonly, tuberculosis (TB) and histoplasmosis. A review of the patient’s history suggested a serious and chronic illness and the patient was admitted to hospital. After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified.

","['Dysphagia, odynophagia, and unexplained chest pain suggest esophageal disease. A globus sensation is reported with esophagopharyngeal conditions, but also occurs with functional GI disorders. Weight loss, anorexia, and fatigue are nonspecific symptoms of neoplastic, inflammatory, gut motility, pancreatic, small-bowel mucosal, and psychiatric conditions. Fever is reported with inflammatory illness, but malignancies also evoke febrile responses. GI disorders also produce extraintestinal symptoms. Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with hepatobiliary dysfunction, skin and eye lesions, and arthritis. Celiac disease may present with dermatitis herpetiformis. Jaundice can produce pruritus. Conversely, systemic diseases can have GI consequences. Systemic lupus may cause gut ischemia, presenting with pain or bleeding. Overwhelming stress or severe burns may lead to gastric ulcer formation. Evaluation of the patient with GI disease begins with a careful history and examination. Subsequent investigation with a variety of tools designed to test gut structure or function are indicated in selected cases. Some patients exhibit normal findings on diagnostic testing. In these individuals, validated symptom profiles are used to confidently diagnose a functional bowel disorder. The history of the patient with suspected GI disease has several components. Symptom timing suggests specific etiologies. Symptoms of short duration commonly result from acute infection, toxin exposure, or abrupt inflammation or ischemia. Long-standing symptoms point to underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic conditions or functional bowel disorders. Symptoms from mechanical obstruction, ischemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional bowel disorders are worsened by meals. Conversely, ulcer symptoms may be relieved by eating or antacids.', 'Abnormal vital signs provide diagnostic clues and determine the need for acute intervention. Fever suggests inflammation or neoplasm. Orthostasis is found with significant blood loss, dehydration, sepsis, or autonomic neuropathy. Skin, eye, or joint findings may point to specific diagnoses. Neck exam with swallowing assessment evaluates dysphagia. Cardiopulmonary disease may present with abdominal pain or nausea; thus lung and cardiac exams are important. Pelvic examination tests for a gynecologic source of abdominal pain. Rectal exam may detect blood, indicating gut mucosal injury or neoplasm or a palpable inflammatory mass in appendicitis. Metabolic conditions and gut motor disorders have associated peripheral neuropathy. Inspection of the abdomen may reveal distention from obstruction, tumor, or ascites or vascular abnormalities with liver disease. Ecchymoses develop with severe pancreatitis. Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers. Laboratory, radiographic, and functional tests can assist in diagnosis of suspected GI disease. The GI tract also is amenable to internal evaluation with upper and lower endoscopy and to examination of luminal contents. Histopathologic exams of GI tissues complement these tests. Laboratory Selected laboratory tests facilitate the diagnosis of GI disease. Iron-deficiency anemia suggests mucosal blood loss, whereas vitamin B12 deficiency results from small-intestinal, gastric, or pancreatic disease. Either also can result from inadequate oral intake. Leukocytosis and increased sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels are found in inflammatory conditions, whereas leukopenia is seen in viremic illness. Severe vomiting or diarrhea elicits electrolyte disturbances, acid-base abnormalities, and elevated blood urea nitrogen. Pancreaticobiliary or liver disease is suggested by elevated pancreatic or liver chemistries. Thyroid chemistries, cortisol, and calcium levels are obtained to exclude endocrinologic causes of GI symptoms. Pregnancy testing is considered for women with unexplained nausea.

","['Adrenocortical hypoand hyperfunction a. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia—This group of disorders is characterized by specific defects in the synthesis of cortisol. In pregnancies at high risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, fetuses can be protected from genital abnormalities by administration of dexamethasone to the mother. The most common defect is a decrease in or lack of P450c21 (21α-hydroxylase) activity. * As can be seen in Figure 39–1, this would lead to a reduction in cortisol synthesis and thus produce a compensatory increase in ACTH release. The adrenal becomes hyper-plastic and produces abnormally large amounts of precursors such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone that can be diverted to the androgen pathway, which leads to virilization and can result in ambiguous genitalia in the female fetus. Metabolism of this compound in the liver leads to pregnanetriol, which is characteristically excreted into the urine in large amounts in this disorder and can be used to make the diagnosis and to monitor efficacy of glucocorticoid substitution. However, the most reliable method of detecting this disorder is the increased response of plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone to ACTH stimulation. If the defect is in 11-hydroxylation, large amounts of deoxycorticosterone are produced, and because this steroid has mineralocorticoid activity, hypertension with or without hypokalemic alkalosis ensues. When 17-hydroxylation is defective in the adrenals and gonads, hypogonadism is also present. However, increased amounts of 11-deoxycorticosterone are formed, and the signs and symptoms associated with mineralocorticoid excess—such as hypertension and hypokalemia— also are observed. When first seen, the infant with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be in acute adrenal crisis and should be treated as described above, using appropriate electrolyte solutions and an intravenous preparation of hydrocortisone in stress doses. Once the patient * Names for the adrenal steroid synthetic enzymes include the following: P450c11 (11β-hydroxylase), P450c17 (17α-hydroxylase), P450c21 (21α-hydroxylase). is stabilized, oral hydrocortisone, 12–18 mg/m2 per day in two unequally divided doses (two thirds in the morning, one third in late afternoon) is begun. The dosage is adjusted to allow normal growth and bone maturation and to prevent androgen excess. Alternate-day therapy with prednisone has also been used to achieve greater ACTH suppression without increasing growth inhibition. Fludrocortisone, 0.05–0.2 mg/d, should also be administered by mouth, with added salt to maintain normal blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and electrolytes. b. Cushing’s syndrome—Cushing’s syndrome is usually the result of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia secondary to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease) but occasionally is due to tumors or nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal gland or ectopic production of ACTH by other tumors. The manifestations are those associated with the chronic presence of excessive glucocorticoids. When glucocorticoid hypersecretion is marked and prolonged, a rounded, plethoric face and trunk obesity are striking in appearance. Protein loss may be significant and includes muscle wasting; thinning, purple striae, and easy bruising of the skin; poor wound healing; and osteoporosis. Other serious disturbances include mental disorders, hypertension, and diabetes. This disorder is treated by surgical removal of the tumor producing ACTH or cortisol, irradiation of the pituitary tumor, or resection of one or both adrenals. These patients must receive large doses of cortisol during and after the surgical procedure. Doses of up to 300 mg of soluble hydrocortisone may be given as a continuous intravenous infusion on the day of surgery. The dose must be reduced slowly to normal replacement levels, since rapid reduction in dose may produce withdrawal symptoms, including fever and joint pain. If adrenalectomy has been performed, long-term maintenance is similar to that outlined above for adrenal insufficiency.', ""1142). In a multi center review of more than 250 pregnancies in women whose prior pregnancies had been complicated by neonatal lupus, recurrence of congenital heart block was signiicantly lower if the woman had been treated with hydroxychloroquine during pregnancy (Izmirly, 2012). Research in this area is ongoing. Maternal terbutaline has also been given to increase the fetal heart rate in cases with sustained bradycardia of any cause in which the fetal heart rate is below 55 bpm. Reversal of hydrops with this therapy has been reported (Cuneo, 2007, 2010). Several autosomal recessive enzyme deiciencies cause impaired fetal synthesis of cortisol from cholesterol by the adrenal cortex. his results in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is the most common etiology of androgen excess in females with 46,X disorders of sex development, formerly female pseudohermaphroditism (Chap. 3, p. 41). Lack of cortisol stimulates adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the anterior pituitary, and the resulting androstenedione and testosterone overproduction leads to virilization of female fetuses. Sequelae may include formation of labioscrotal folds, persistence of a urogenital sinus, or even creation of a penile urethra and scrotal sac. More than 90 percent ofCAH cases are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is found in classic and nonclassic forms. he incidence of classic CAH approximates 1: 15000 births overall and is higher in selected populations. For example, it has been reported in approximately 1 :300 Yupik Eskimos (Nimkarn, 2010). Among those with classic CAH, 75 percent are at risk for salt-wasting adrenal crises and require postnatal treatment with mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids to prevent hyponatremia, dehydration, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse. The remaining 25 percent with classic CAH have the simple virilizing ype and also require glucocorticoid supplementation. As discussed in Chapter 32 (p. 614), all states mandate newborn screening for CAH. he eicacy of maternal dexamethasone treatment to suppress fetal androgen overproduction and either obviate or ameliorate virilization of female fetuses has been recognized for more than 30 years (David, 1984; New, 2012). Prenatal corti costeroid therapy is considered successful in 80 to 85 percent of cases (Miller, 2013; Speiser, 2010). The alternative is con sideration of postnatal genitoplasty, a complex and somewhat controversial surgical procedure (Braga, 2009). he tpical preventive regimen is oral dexamethasone given to the mother at a dosage of 20 Lg/kg/d-up to 1.5 mg per day, divided in three doses.

Some of these individuals have high levels of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, and these levels are maintained over the course of infection. The inheritance of particular HLA alleles seems to correlate with resistance to disease progression, perhaps reflecting the ability to mount anti-viral T cell responses. In the following section, we summarize the clinical manifestations of the terminal phase of the disease, full-blown AIDS. In the United States, the typical adult patient with AIDS presents with fever, weight loss, diarrhea, generalized lymphadenopathy, multiple opportunistic infections, neurologic disease, and, in many cases, secondary neoplasms. Opportunistic infections account for the majority of deaths in untreated patients with AIDS. Many of these infections represent reactivation of latent infections, which are normally kept in check by a robust immune system but are not completely eradicated because the infectious agents have evolved to coexist with their hosts. The actual frequency of infections varies in different regions of the world, and has been markedly reduced by the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (called HAART or ART), which relies on a combination of three or four drugs that block different steps of the HIV life cycle. Approximately 15% to 30% of untreated HIV-infected individuals develop pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci at some time during the course of the disease. Before the advent of HAART, this infection was the presenting feature in about 20% of cases, but the incidence is much less in patients who respond to HAART. Candidiasis is the most common fungal infection in patients with AIDS, and infection of the oral cavity, vagina, and esophagus are its most common clinical manifestations. In HIV-infected individuals, oral candidiasis is a sign of immunologic decompensation, and often heralds the transition to AIDS. Invasive candidiasis is infrequent in patients with AIDS, and it usually occurs when there is drug-induced neutropenia or use of indwelling catheters. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may cause disseminated disease, but more commonly affects the eye and gastrointestinal tract. Chorioretinitis used to be seen in approximately 25% of patients, but has decreased dramatically after the initiation of HAART. CMV retinitis occurs almost exclusively in patients with CD4+ T cell counts less than 50 per microliter. Gastrointestinal CMV infection, seen in 5% to 10% of cases, manifests as esophagitis and colitis, the latter associated with multiple mucosal ulcerations. Disseminated bacterial infection with nontuberculous, or atypical, mycobacteria (mainly Mycobacterium aviumintracellulare) also occurs late, in the setting of severe immunosuppression. Coincident with the AIDS epidemic, the incidence of tuberculosis has risen dramatically. Worldwide, almost one third of all deaths in AIDS patients are attributable to tuberculosis, but this compli cation remains uncommon in the United States. Both reactivation of latent pulmonary disease and new primary infection contribute to this toll. As with tuberculosis in other settings, the infection may be confined to lungs or may involve multiple organs. Most worrisome are reports indicating that a growing number of isolates are resistant to multiple anti-mycobacterial drugs. Cryptococcosis occurs in about 10% of AIDS patients. As in other settings with immunosuppression, meningitis is the major clinical manifestation of cryptococcosis. Toxoplasma gondii, another frequent invader of the CNS in AIDS, causes encephalitis and is responsible for 50% of all mass lesions in the CNS. JC virus, a human papovavirus, is another important cause of CNS infections in HIV-infected patients. It causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Chapter 23). Herpes simplex virus infection is manifested by mucocutaneous ulcerations involving the mouth, esophagus, external genitalia, and perianal region. Persistent diarrhea, which is common in untreated patients with advanced AIDS, is often caused by infections with protozoans or enteric bacteria. Patients with AIDS have a high incidence of certain tumors, notably Kaposi sarcoma, B cell lymphoma, cervical cancer in women, and anal cancer in men. These tumors are often considered AIDS-defining malignancies. It is estimated that 25% to 40% of untreated HIV-infected individuals will eventually develop a malignancy. Many of these tumors are caused by oncogenic DNA viruses, including Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi sarcoma), EBV (B cell lymphoma), and human papillomavirus (cervical and anal carcinoma). These viruses establish latent infections that are kept in check in healthy individuals by a competent immune system. The increased risk for malignancy in AIDS patients exists mainly because of failure to contain the infection following reactivation of the viruses and decreased cellular immunity against virally infected cells undergoing malignant transformation. The incidence of many of these tumors, especially Kaposi sarcoma, is decreasing as treatment has improved and patients have less immune compromise. Nevertheless, HIV-infected individuals remain more susceptible to tumors that occur in the general population, such as lung and skin cancers and certain forms of lymphoma. Kaposi Sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a vascular tumor that is otherwise rare in the United States, is considered an AIDS-defining malignancy. The morphology of KS and its occurrence in patients not infected with HIV are discussed in Chapter 10. At the onset of the AIDS epidemic, up to 30% of infected homosexual or bisexual men had KS, but with use of HAART there has been a dramatic decline in its incidence in recent years. In contrast, in areas of sub-Saharan Africa where HIV infection is both frequent and largely untreated, Kaposi sarcoma is one of the most common tumors. The lesions of KS are characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells that express markers of both endothelial cells (vascular or lymphatic) and smooth muscle cells. http://ebooksmedicine.net\n\n\n\nIn addition, KS lesions contain chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates. Many of the features of KS suggest that it is not a malignant tumor (despite its ominous name). There is compelling evidence that KS is caused by the KS herpesvirus (KSHV), also called human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). Exactly how KSHV infection leads to KS is still unclear. Like other herpesviruses, KSHV establishes latent infection, during which several proteins are produced with potential roles in stimulating spindle cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis. These include a viral homologue of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D (an oncogene) and several inhibitors of p53 (a key tumor suppressor gene), both of which have been implicated in tumor development (Chapter 6). The spindle cells produce proinflammatory and angiogenic factors, which recruit the inflammatory and neovascular components of the lesion, and the latter components supply signals that aid in spindle cell survival and growth. However, KSHV infection, while necessary for KS development, is not sufficient, and additional cofactors are needed. In the AIDS-related form, that cofactor is clearly HIV. HIV-mediated immune suppression may aid in widespread dissemination of KSHV in the host. Clinically, AIDS-associated KS is quite different from the sporadic form (Chapter 10). In HIV-infected individuals, the tumor is usually widespread, affecting the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, and lungs. These tumors also tend to be more aggressive than sporadic KS. Lymphomas. Lymphoma occurs at a markedly increased rate in individuals with AIDS, making it another AIDS-defining tumor. Roughly 5% of AIDS patients present with lymphoma, and approximately another 5% develop lymphoma during their subsequent course. Even in the era of anti-retroviral therapy, lymphoma continues to occur in HIV-infected individuals at an incidence that is at least 10-fold greater than the population average. Based on molecular characterization of HIV-associated lymphomas and the epidemiologic considerations above, at least two mechanisms appear to underlie the increased risk for B-cell tumors in HIV-infected individuals. Tumors Induced by Oncogenic Viruses. T-cell immunity is required to restrain the proliferation of B cells latently infected with oncogenic viruses such as EBV and KSHV. With the appearance of severe T-cell depletion in the course of HIV infection, this control is lost, and the infected B cells undergo unchecked proliferation that predispose to mutations and the development of B-cell tumors. As a result, AIDS patients are at high risk for developing aggressive B-cell lymphomas composed of tumor cells infected by oncogenic viruses, particularly EBV. The tumors often occur in extranodal sites, such as the CNS, gut, orbit, and lungs, and elsewhere. AIDS patients also are prone to rare lymphomas that present as malignant effusions (so-called “primary effusion lymphoma”), which are remarkable in that the tumor cells are usually coinfected by both EBV and KSHV, a highly unusual example of cooperativity between two oncogenic viruses. Germinal Center B-Cell Hyperplasia. The majority of the lymphomas that arise in patients with preserved CD4 T-cell counts are not associated with EBV or KSHV. The increased risk for lymphoma in these patients may be related to the profound germinal center B cell hyperplasia that occurs in HIV infection. The high level of proliferation and somatic mutations that occur in germinal center B cells set the stage for chromosomal translocations and mutations involving tumor-causing genes. In fact, the aggressive B-cell tumors that arise outside the setting of severe T cell depletion in HIV-infected individuals, such as Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, often are associated with mutations in oncogenes such as MYC and BCL6 that bear the molecular hallmarks of “mistakes” during the attempted diversification of immunoglobulin genes in germinal center B cells. Several other EBV-related proliferations also merit mention. Hodgkin lymphoma, an unusual B-cell tumor associated with a pronounced tissue inflammatory response (Chapter 12), also occurs at increased frequency in HIV-infected individuals. In virtually all instances of HIV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma, the characteristic tumor cells (Reed-Sternberg cells) are infected with EBV. Many (but not all) HIV patients with Hodgkin lymphoma have low CD4 counts at the time of disease presentation. EBV infection also is responsible for oral hairy leukoplakia (white projections on the tongue), which results from EBV-driven squamous cell proliferation of the oral mucosa (Chapter 15). Other Tumors. In addition to KS and lymphomas, patients with AIDS also have an increased occurrence of carcinoma of the uterine cervix and of anal cancer. Both of these tumors are highly associated with human papilloma virus infection, which is poorly controlled in the setting of immunosuppression. Involvement of the CNS is a common and important manifestation of AIDS. Ninety percent of patients demonstrate some form of neurologic involvement at autopsy, and 40% to 60% have clinically apparent neurologic dysfunction. Importantly, in some patients, neurologic manifestations may be the sole or earliest presenting feature of HIV infection. Lesions include a self-limited presumed viral meningoencephalitis or aseptic meningitis, vacuolar myelopathy, peripheral neuropathies, and, most commonly, a progressive encephalopathy called HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (Chapter 23). Effect of Anti-Retroviral Drug Therapy on the Course of HIV Infection\n\n\n\nThe advent of new drugs that target the viral reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase enzymes has changed the clinical face of AIDS. When a combination of at least three effective drugs is used in a motivated, compliant patient, HIV replication is reduced to below the threshold of detection (<50 RNA copies/mL) and remains there as long as the patient adheres to therapy. Once the virus is suppressed, the progressive loss of CD4+ T cells is halted, and the peripheral CD4+ T-cell count slowly increases, often returning to a normal level. With the use of these drugs, the annual death rate from AIDS in the United States has decreased from a peak of 16 to 18 per 100,000 individuals in 1995–1996 to less than 4 per 100,000. Many AIDS-associated disorders, such as opportunistic infections with http://ebooksmedicine.net\n\n\n\nP. jiroveci and Kaposi sarcoma, now are uncommon. Effective anti-retroviral therapy also has reduced the transmission of the virus, especially from infected mothers to newborns. Despite these dramatic improvements, several new complications associated with HIV infection and its treatment have emerged. Some patients with advanced disease who are given anti-retroviral therapy develop a paradoxical clinical deterioration during the period of recovery of the immune system despite increasing CD4+ T-cell counts and decreasing viral load. This disorder, called the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, is not understood but is postulated to be a poorly regulated host response to the high antigenic burden of persistent microbes. Perhaps a more important complication of long-term anti-retroviral therapy pertains to adverse side effects of the drugs. These include lipoatrophy (loss of facial fat), lipoaccumulation (excess fat deposition centrally), elevated lipids, insulin resistance, peripheral neuropathy, and premature cardiovascular, kidney, and liver disease. Finally, non-AIDS morbidity is far more common than classic AIDS-related morbidity in long-term HAART-treated patients. Major causes of morbidity are cancer and accelerated cardiovascular disease.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['HIV-1 NAT        HIV-1 NAT NAT: nucleic acid test\n\n\n\nTime course of untreated HIV infection +/– Acute HIV infection Skin and mucous Systemic immuno-Viral dissemination membrane defciency/AIDS-Seeding of lymphoid organs Clinical latency infections defning illnesses\n\n\n\nDashed lines on CD4+ count axis indicate moderate immunocompromise Four stages of untreated infection: (< 400 CD4+ cells/mm3) and when AIDS-defining illnesses emerge (< 200 1.

Other causes include bilateral vestibular schwannomas (neurofibromatosis type 2), autoimmune disease, superficial siderosis, and meningeal-based infection or tumor. It also may occur in patients with peripheral polyneuropathy; in these patients, both vestibular loss and impaired proprioception may contribute to poor balance. Finally, unilateral processes such as vestibular neuritis and Ménière’s disease may involve both ears sequentially, resulting in bilateral vestibulopathy. Examination findings include diminished dynamic visual acuity (see above) due to loss of stable vision when the head is moving, abnormal head impulse responses in both directions, and a Romberg sign. Responses to caloric testing are reduced. Patients with bilateral vestibular hypofunction should be referred for vestibular rehabilitation therapy. Vestibular suppressant medications should not be used, as they will increase the imbalance. Evaluation by a neurologist is important not only to confirm the diagnosis but also to consider any other associated neurologic abnormalities that may clarify the etiology. Central lesions causing vertigo typically involve vestibular pathways in the brainstem and/or cerebellum. They may be due to discrete lesions, such as from ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (Chap.', 'Walker, Robert B. Daroff\n\n\n\nDizziness is an imprecise symptom used to describe a variety of sensations that include vertigo, light-headedness, faintness, and imbalance. When used to describe a sense of spinning or other motion, dizziness is designated as vertigo. Vertigo may be physiologic, occurring during or after a sustained head rotation, or it may be pathologic, due to vestibular dysfunction. The term light-headedness is commonly applied to presyncopal sensations due to brain hypoperfusion but also may refer to disequilibrium and imbalance. A challenge to diagnosis is that patients often have difficulty distinguishing among these various symptoms, and the words they choose do not reliably indicate the underlying etiology. There are a number of potential causes of dizziness. Vascular disorders cause presyncopal dizziness as a result of cardiac dysrhythmia, orthostatic hypotension, medication effects, or other causes. Such presyncopal sensations vary in duration; they may increase in severity until loss of consciousness occurs, or they may resolve before loss of consciousness if the cerebral ischemia is corrected. Faintness and syncope, which are discussed in detail in Chap. 27, should always be considered when one is evaluating patients with brief episodes of dizziness or dizziness that occurs with upright posture. Vestibular causes of dizziness (vertigo or imbalance) may be due to peripheral lesions that affect the labyrinths or vestibular nerves or to involvement of the central vestibular pathways. They may be paroxysmal or due to a fixed unilateral or bilateral vestibular deficit. Acute unilateral lesions cause vertigo due to a sudden imbalance in vestibular inputs from the two labyrinths. Bilateral lesions cause imbalance and instability of vision (oscillopsia) when the head moves. Other causes of dizziness include nonvestibular imbalance and gait disorders (e.g., loss of proprioception from sensory neuropathy, parkinsonism) and anxiety.

Lateral geniculatebody ■Open-angle glaucoma is much more common in the United States than closed-angle glaucoma. Occurs when the iris dilates and pushes against the lens of the eye, disrupting ﬂow of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber. Pressure in the posterior chamber then pushes the peripheral iris forward and blocks the angle. Risk factors include family history, older age, Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, prolonged pupillary dilation (prolonged time in a dark area, stress, medications), anterior uveitis, and lens dislocation. Hx/PE: Classically presents with extreme eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and vomiting. A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is ↑. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes. Dx: Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Those that resolve may mimic a migraine headache with blurred vision; the distinction is that the headaches and blurred vision are more likely to be triggered by darkness (due to pupillary dilation) rather than by bright lights (migraine). Tx: This is a medical emergency that can cause blindness. Treatment to ↓ IOP may include eyedrops (timolol, pilocarpine, apraclonidine) or systemic medications (oral or IV acetazolamide, IV mannitol). Laser peripheral iridotomy, which creates a hole in the peripheral iris, is curative and may be performed prophylactically. generally occurs bilaterally, ■Flow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork is limited, in- creasing IOP.

In the United States, macular degeneration is the leading cause of permanent bilateral visual loss in the elderly. Risk factors include age > 40 years, African-American ethnicity, diabetes, and myopia. Hx/PE: Usually asymptomatic until late in the clinical course, when patients may begin to notice visual deficits. Should be suspected in patients > 35 years of age who need frequent lens changes and have mild headaches, visual disturbances, and impaired adaptation to darkness. The earliest visual defect is seen in the peripheral nasal fields. Cupping of the optic nerve head is seen on funduscopic exam. Dx: Tonometry, ophthalmoscopic visualization of the optic nerve, and visual field testing are most important. A diseased trabecular meshwork obstructs proper drainage of the eye, gradually increasing pressure and leading to progressive vision loss. Tx: Treat with topical β-blockers (timolol, betaxolol) to ↓ aqueous humor production or with pilocarpine to ↑ aqueous outﬂow. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used. If medication fails, laser trabeculoplasty or a trabeculectomy can improve aqueous drainage. More common among Caucasians, females, smokers, and those with a family history. Presents with painless loss of central vision. Atrophic (“dry”) macular degeneration: Responsible for 80% of cases. Causes gradual vision loss. Exudative or neovascular (“wet”) macular degeneration: Much less common, but associated with more rapid and severe vision damage. Funduscopy by an ophthalmologist reveals drusen and/or pigmentary changes in patients with atrophic AMD. Hemorrhage and subretinal ﬂuid are suggestive of exudative AMD. Atrophic AMD:\n\n\n\nNo treatment is currently available, although a combination of vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and zinc) has been found to slow disease progression. An ↑ mortality rate from high doses of vitamin E and an elevated lung cancer incidence among individuals on beta-carotene supplementation may require modification of this regimen for smokers. Exudative AMD:\n\n\n\nVEGF inhibitors have been shown to improve vision (ranibizumab, bevacizumab) or slow visual loss (pegaptanib) in patients with exudative AMD. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, which involves use of a laser to selectively target retinal vessels, may be useful in conjunction with VEGF inhibitors. Occurs in elderly patients and is often idiopathic. Hx/PE:\n\n\n\nCentral retinal artery occlusion: Presents with sudden, painless, unilateral blindness. The pupil reacts to a near stimulus but is sluggishly reactive to direct light. Patients present with a cherry-red spot on the fovea, retinal swelling (whitish appearance to the nerve fiber layer), and retinal arteries that may appear bloodless. Central retinal vein occlusion: Characterized by rapid, painless vision loss of variable severity. A choked, swollen optic disk with hemorrhages, venous stasis retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and edema of the macula may be seen on funduscopic exam. Tx:\n\n\n\nCentral retinal artery occlusion: Intra-arterial thrombolysis of the ophthalmic artery within eight hours of onset of symptoms may produce benefit in some patients, although evidence remains controversial. Other treatments applied but of unclear benefit include increasing IOP through drainage of the anterior chamber or IV acetazolamide. If implemented, treatments should be applied immediately before irreversible retinal infarction and permanent blindness ensue.

Gravidity: The number of times a woman has been pregnant. Parity: The number of pregnancies that led to a birth beyond 20 weeks’ gestational age or an infant weighing > 500 g. Developmental age (DA): The number of weeks and days since fertilization. Typically used only in research, as the exact date of fertilization is not commonly known. Gestational age (GA): The number of weeks and days measured from the frst day of the last menstrual period (LMP). GA can also be determined by:\n\n\n\nFundal height: At 20 weeks, the uterus is at the umbilicus and grows approximately 1 cm/week. Quickening, or appreciation of fetal movement: Typically occurs at 17–18 weeks. Fetal heart tones: Can be heard at 10–12 weeks by Doppler. Ultrasound: Measures fetal crown-rump length (CRL) at 5–12 weeks and measures biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC) from 13 weeks. Ultrasound measurement of GA is most reliable during the f rst trimester. Normal Physiology of Pregnancy\n\n\n\nThe normal physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy are graphically illustrated according to system in Figures 2.11-2 and 2.11-3. Nägele’s rule: due date = last menstrual period + nine months + seven days.', 'Without treatment, increased intraocular pressure results in damage to the retina and optic nerve, with restriction of visual fields and, eventually, blindness. Intraocular pressure is easily measured as part of the routine ophthalmologic examination. Two major types of glaucoma are recognized: open-angle and closed-angle (also called narrow-angle). The closed-angle form is associated with a shallow anterior chamber, in which a dilated iris can occlude the outflow drainage pathway at the angle between the cornea and the ciliary body (see Figure 6–9). This form is associated with acute and painful increases of pressure, which must be controlled on an emergency basis with drugs or prevented by surgical removal of part of the iris (iridectomy). The open-angle form of glaucoma is a chronic condition, and treatment is largely pharmacologic. Because intraocular pressure is a function of the balance between fluid input and drainage out of the globe, the strategies for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma fall into two classes: reduction of aqueous humor secretion and enhancement of aqueous outflow. Five general groups of drugs—cholinomimetics, α agonists, β blockers, prostaglandin F2α analogs, and diuretics—have been found to be useful in reducing intraocular pressure and can be related to these strategies as shown in Table 10–3. Of the five drug groups listed in Table 10–3, the prostaglandin analogs and the β blockers are the most popular. This popularity results from convenience (onceor twice-daily dosing) and relative lack of adverse effects (except, in the case of β blockers, in patients with asthma or cardiac pacemaker or conduction pathway disease). Other drugs that have been reported to reduce intraocular pressure include prostaglandin E2 and marijuana. The use of drugs in acute closed-angle glaucoma is limited to cholinomimetics, acetazolamide, and osmotic agents preceding surgery. The onset of action of the other agents is too slow in this situation.']","['1', '""This is a medical emergency that can cause blindness.""\n2', '""Treatment to ↓ IOP may include eyedrops (timolol, pilocarpine, apraclonidine) or systemic medications (oral or IV acetazolamide, IV mannitol).""\n3', '""Laser peripheral iridotomy, which creates a hole in the peripheral iris, is curative and may be performed prophylactically.""\n4', '""The closed-angle form is associated with a shallow anterior chamber, in which a dilated iris can occlude the outflow drainage pathway at the angle between the cornea and the ciliary body.""\n5', '""This form is associated with acute and painful increases of pressure, which must be controlled on an emergency basis with drugs or prevented by surgical removal of part of the iris (iridectomy).""']",0.07407407407407407,"['Acute Angle-Closure glaucoma This is an unusual but frequently misdiagnosed cause of a red, painful eye. Asian populations have a particularly high risk of angle-closure glaucoma. Susceptible eyes have a shallow anterior chamber because the eye has either a short axial length (hyperopia) or a lens enlarged by the gradual development of cataract. When the pupil becomes mid-dilated, the peripheral iris blocks aqueous outflow via the anterior chamber angle and the intraocular pressure rises abruptly, producing pain, injection, corneal edema, obscurations, and blurred vision. In some patients, ocular symptoms are overshadowed by nausea, vomiting, or headache, prompting a fruitless workup for abdominal or neurologic disease. The diagnosis is made by measuring the intraocular pressure during an acute attack or by performing gonioscopy, a procedure that allows one to observe a narrow chamber angle with a mirrored contact lens.

","['Lofholm, PharmD, & Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD\n\n\n\nOnce a patient with a clinical problem has been evaluated and a diagnosis has been reached, the practitioner can often select from a variety of therapeutic approaches. Medication, surgery, psychiatric treatment, radiation, physical therapy, health education, counseling, further consultation (second opinions), and no therapy are some of the options available. Of these options, drug therapy is by far the one most frequently chosen.', 'Within the last 24 months, the individual has made a suicide attempt. Note: A suicide attempt is a seIf-initiated sequence of behaviors by an individual who, at the time of initiation, expected that the set of actions would lead to his or her own death. The “time of initiation"" is the time when a behavior took place that involved ap- plying the method.)\n\n\n\nB. The act does not meet criteria for nonsuicidal seIf-injury—that is, it does not involve self-injury directed to the surface of the body undertaken to induce relief from a nega- tive feeling/cognitive state or to achieve a positive mood state. C. The diagnosis is not applied to suicidal ideation or to preparatory acts. D. The act was not initiated during a state of delirium or confusion. E. The act was not undertaken solely for a political or religious objective. Specify if:\n\n\n\nCurrent: Not more than 12 months since the last attempt. In early remission: 12—24 months since the last attempt. Suicidal behavior is often categorized in terms of violence of the method. Generally, over— doses with legal or illegal substances are considered nonviolent in method, whereas jump- ing, gunshot wounds, and other methods are considered violent. Another dimension for classification is medical consequences of the behavior, with high—lethality attempts being defined as those requiring medical hospitalization beyond a visit to an emergency depart- ment. An additional dimension considered includes the degree of planning versus impul— siveness of the attempt, a characteristic that might have consequences for the medical outcome of a suicide attempt. If the suicidal behavior occurred 12—24 months prior to evaluation, the condition is considered to be in early remission. Individuals remain at higher risk for further suicide at- tempts and death in the 24 months after a suicide attempt, and the period 12—24 months af— ter the behavior took place is specified as ""early remission.""\n\n\n\nThe essential manifestation of suicidal behavior disorder is a suicide attempt. A suicide at— tempt is a behavior that the individual has undertaken with at least some intent to die. The behavior might or might not lead to injury or serious medical consequences. Several fac- tors can inﬂuence the medical consequences of the suicide attempt, including poor plan- ning, lack of knowledge about the lethality of the method chosen, low intentionality or ambivalence, or chance intervention by others after the behavior has been initiated. These should not be considered in assigning the diagnosis. Determining the degree of intent can be challenging. Individuals might not acknowl— edge intent, especially in situations where doing so could result in hospitalization or cause distress to loved ones. Markers of risk include degree of planning, including selection of a time and place to minimize rescue or interruption; the individual’s mental state at the time of the behavior, with acute agitation being especially concerning; recent discharge from inpatient care; or recent discontinuation of a mood stabilizer such as lithium or an anti- psychotic such as clozapine in the case of schizophrenia. Examples of environmental “trig- gers” include recently learning of a potentially fatal medical diagnosis such as cancer, experiencing the sudden and unexpected loss of a close relative or partner, loss of employ— ment, or displacement from housing. Conversely, features such as talking to others about future events or preparedness to sign a contract for safety are less reliable indicators. In order for the criteria to be met, the individual must have made at least one suicide at- tempt. Suicide attempts can include behaviors in which, after initiating the suicide attempt, the individual changed his or her mind or someone intervened. For example, an individual might intend to ingest a given amount of medication or poison, but either stop or be stopped by another before ingesting the full amount. If the individual is dissuaded by another or changes his or her mind before initiating the behavior, the diagnosis should not be made. The act must not meet criteria for nonsuicidal self—injury—that is, it should not involve re- peated (at least five times within the past 12 months) self-injurious episodes undertaken to induce relief from a negative feeling/ cognitive state or to achieve a positive mood state. The act should not have been initiated during a state of delirium or confusion.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Although suicidal and homicidal behaviors are absolute indications for referral, many physicians fear that questioning patients about these behaviors will provoke them. That is not the case (12). An open discussion of impulses to hurt oneself or someone else helps the patient to regain control, recognize the need for mental health care, or agree to emergency interventions such as psychiatric hospitalization, whereas avoiding the subject intensifies the patient’s feelings of isolation. The management of suicidal behavior is addressed later in this chapter in the section on mood disorders.', 'The diagnosis of a mental disorder should have clinical utility: it should help clinicians to determine prognosis, treatment plans, and potential treatment outcomes for their pa- tients. However, the diagnosis of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treat- ment. Need for treatment is a complex clinical decision that takes into consideration symptom severity, symptom salience (e.g., the presence of suicidal ideation), the patient’s distress (mental pain) associated with the symptom(s), disability related to the patient’s symptoms, risks and benefits of available treatments, and other factors (e.g., psychiatric symptoms complicating other illness). Clinicians may thus encounter individuals whose for treatment or care. The fact that some individuals do not show all symptoms indicative of a diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to appropriate care.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0

Such a diagnosis requires demonstration of the absence of cerebral function (no response to any external stimulus) and brainstem functions (e.g., unreactive pupils, lack of ocular movement in response to head turning or ice-water irrigation of ear canals, positive apnea test [no drive to breathe]). Absence of brain function must have an established cause and be permanent without possibility of recovery; a sedative effect, hypothermia, hypoxemia, neuromuscular paralysis, and severe hypotension must be ruled out. If there is uncertainty about the cause of coma, studies of cerebral blood flow and electroencephalography should be performed. (See also Chap. 10) Withholding or withdrawal of care occurs commonly in the ICU setting. The Task Force on Ethics of the Society of Critical Care Medicine reported that it is ethically sound to withhold or withdraw care if a patient or the patient’s surrogate makes such a request or if the physician judges that the goals of therapy are not achievable. Since all medical treatments are justified by their expected benefits, the loss of such an expectation justifies the act of withdrawing or withholding such treatment; these two actions are judged to be fundamentally similar. An underlying stipulation derived from this report is that an informed patient should have his or her wishes respected with regard to life-sustaining therapy. Implicit in this stipulation is the need to ensure that patients are thoroughly and accurately informed regarding the plausibility and expected results of various therapies. The act of informing patients and/or surrogate decision-makers is the responsibility of the physician and other health care providers. If a patient or surrogate desires therapy deemed futile by the treating physician, the physician is not obligated ethically to provide such treatment. Rather, arrangements may be made to transfer the patient’s care to another care provider. Whether the decision to withdraw\n\n\n\nApproach to the Patient with Critical Illness 1736 life support should be initiated by the physician or left to surrogate decision-makers alone is not clear. One study reported that slightly more than half of surrogate decision-makers preferred to receive such a recommendation, whereas the rest did not. Critical care providers should meet regularly with patients and/or surrogates to discuss prognosis when the withholding or withdrawal of care is being considered. After a consensus among caregivers has been reached, this information should be relayed to the patient and/or surrogate decision-maker. If a decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining care for a patient has been made, aggressive attention to analgesia and anxiolysis is needed.

","['Nodular involvement can occur, and the condition can rarely extend over the whole lower leg and foot, mimicking elephantiasis. Thyroid acropachy refers to a form of clubbing found in <1% of patients with Graves’ disease (Fig. 405-8C). It is so strongly associated with thyroid dermopathy that an alternative cause of clubbing should be sought in a Graves’ patient without coincident skin and orbital involvement. Laboratory Evaluation Investigations used to determine the existence and cause of thyrotoxicosis are summarized in Fig. 405-9. In Graves’ disease, the TSH level is suppressed, and total and unbound thyroid hormone levels are increased. In 2–5% of patients (and more in areas of borderline iodine intake), only T3 is increased (T3 toxicosis). The converse state of T4 toxicosis, with elevated total and unbound T4 and normal T3 levels, is occasionally seen when hyperthyroidism is induced by excess iodine, providing surplus substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis. Measurement of TPO antibodies or TRAb may be useful if the diagnosis is unclear clinically but is not needed routinely. Associated abnormalities that may cause diagnostic confusion in thyrotoxicosis include elevation of bilirubin, liver enzymes, and ferritin. Microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur. Differential Diagnosis Diagnosis of Graves’ disease is straightforward in a patient with biochemically confirmed thyrotoxicosis, diffuse goiter on palpation, ophthalmopathy, and often a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders. For patients with thyrotoxicosis who lack these features, the diagnosis is generally established by a radionuclide (99mTc, 123I, or 131I) scan and uptake of the thyroid, which will distinguish the diffuse, high uptake of Graves’ disease from destructive thyroiditis, ectopic thyroid tissue, and factitious thyrotoxicosis. Scintigraphy is the preferred diagnostic test; however, TRAb measurement can be used to assess autoimmune activity. In secondary hyperthyroidism due to a 2296 TSH-secreting pituitary tumor, there is also a diffuse goiter. The presence of a nonsuppressed TSH level and the finding of a pituitary tumor on CT or magnetic resonance scan (MRI) scan suggest this diagnosis. Clinical features of thyrotoxicosis can mimic certain aspects of other disorders, including panic attacks, mania, pheochromocytoma, and weight loss associated with malignancy. The diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis can be easily excluded if the TSH and unbound T4 and T3 levels are normal. A normal TSH also excludes Graves’ disease as a cause of diffuse goiter. Clinical Course Clinical features generally worsen without treatment; mortality was 10–30% before the introduction of satisfactory therapy. Some patients with mild Graves’ disease experience spontaneous relapses and remissions. Rarely, there may be fluctuation between hypoand hyperthyroidism due to changes in the functional activity of TSH-R antibodies. About 15% of patients who enter remission after treatment develop hypothyroidism 10–15 years later as a result of the destructive autoimmune process. The clinical course of ophthalmopathy does not follow that of the thyroid disease. Ophthalmopathy typically worsens over the initial 3–6 months, followed by a plateau phase over the next 12–18 months, with spontaneous improvement, particularly in the soft tissue changes. However, the course is more fulminant in up to 5% of patients, requiring intervention in the acute phase if there is optic nerve compression or corneal ulceration. Diplopia may appear late in the disease due to fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. Radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism worsens the eye disease in a small proportion of patients (especially smokers). Antithyroid drugs or surgery have no adverse effects on the clinical course of ophthalmopathy. Thyroid dermopathy, when it occurs, usually appears 1–2 years after the development of Graves’ hyperthyroidism; it may improve spontaneously. The hyperthyroidism of Graves’ disease is treated by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, using antithyroid drugs, or reducing the amount of thyroid tissue with radioiodine (131I) treatment or by thyroidectomy. Antithyroid drugs are the predominant therapy in many centers in Europe and Japan, whereas radioiodine is more often the first line of treatment in North America. These differences reflect the fact that no single approach is optimal and that patients may require multiple treatments to achieve remission. The main antithyroid drugs are the thionamides, such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole (not available in the United States), and the active metabolite of the latter, methimazole. All inhibit the function of TPO, reducing oxidation and organification of iodide. These drugs also reduce thyroid antibody levels by mechanisms that remain unclear, and they appear to enhance rates of remission. Propylthiouracil inhibits deiodination of T4 → T3. However, this effect is of minor benefit, except in the most severe thyrotoxicosis, and is offset by the much shorter half-life of this drug (90 min) compared to methimazole (6 h). Due to the hepatotoxicity of propylthiouracil, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited indications for its use to the first trimester of pregnancy, the treatment of thyroid storm, and patients with minor adverse reactions to methimazole. If propylthiouracil is used, monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. There are many variations of antithyroid drug regimens. The initial dose of carbimazole or methimazole is usually 10–20 mg every 8 or 12 h, but once-daily dosing is possible after euthyroidism is restored. Propylthiouracil is given at a dose of 100–200 mg every 6–8 h, and divided doses are usually given throughout the course. Lower doses of each drug may suffice in areas of low iodine intake. The starting dose of antithyroid drugs can be gradually reduced (titration regimen) as thyrotoxicosis improves. Alternatively, high doses may be given combined with levothyroxine supplementation (block-replace regimen) to avoid drug-induced hypothyroidism. The titration regimen is preferred to minimize the dose of antithyroid drug and provide an index of treatment response. Thyroid function tests and clinical manifestations are reviewed 4–6 weeks after starting treatment, and the dose is titrated based on unbound T4 levels. Most patients do not achieve euthyroidism until 6–8 weeks after treatment is initiated. TSH levels often remain suppressed for several months and therefore do not provide a sensitive index of treatment response. The usual daily maintenance doses of antithyroid drugs in the titration regimen are 2.5–10 mg of carbimazole or methimazole and 50–100 mg of propylthiouracil. In the block-replace regimen, the initial dose of antithyroid drug is held constant, and the dose of levothyroxine is adjusted to maintain normal unbound T4 levels. When TSH suppression is alleviated, TSH levels can also be used to monitor therapy. Maximum remission rates (up to 30–60% in some populations) are achieved by 12–18 months for the titration regimen and by 6 months for the block-replace regimen. For unclear reasons, remission rates appear to vary in different geographic regions. Younger patients, males, smokers, and patients with severe hyperthyroidism and large goiters are most likely to relapse when treatment stops, but outcomes are difficult to predict. All patients should be followed closely for relapse during the first year after treatment and at least annually thereafter. The common minor side effects of antithyroid drugs are rash, urticaria, fever, and arthralgia (1–5% of patients). These may resolve spontaneously or after substituting an alternative antithyroid drug. Rare but major side effects include hepatitis (propylthiouracil; avoid use in children) and cholestasis (methimazole and carbimazole); an SLE-like syndrome; and, most important, agranulocytosis (<1%). It is essential that antithyroid drugs are stopped and not restarted if a patient develops major side effects. Written instructions should be provided regarding the symptoms of possible agranulocytosis (e.g., sore throat, fever, mouth ulcers) and the need to stop treatment pending an urgent complete blood count to confirm that agranulocytosis is not present. Management of agranulocytosis is described in Chap. 130. It is not useful to monitor blood counts prospectively, because the onset of agranulocytosis is idiosyncratic and abrupt. Propranolol (20–40 mg every 6 h) or longer-acting selective β1 receptor blockers such as atenolol may be helpful to control adrenergic symptoms, especially in the early stages before antithyroid drugs take effect. Beta blockers are also useful in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, pending correction of thyrotoxicosis. In consultation with a cardiologist, anticoagulation with warfarin should be considered in all patients with atrial fibrillation who often spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm with control of hyperthyroidism. Decreased warfarin doses are required when patients are thyrotoxic. If digoxin is used, increased doses are often needed in the thyrotoxic state. Radioiodine causes progressive destruction of thyroid cells and can be used as initial treatment or for relapses after a trial of antithyroid drugs. There is a small risk of thyrotoxic crisis (see below) after radioiodine, which can be minimized by pretreatment with antithyroid drugs for at least a month before treatment. Antecedent treatment with antithyroid drugs should be considered for all elderly patients or for those with cardiac problems to deplete thyroid hormone stores before administration of radioiodine. Carbimazole or methimazole must be stopped 3–5 days before radioiodine administration to achieve optimum iodine uptake. Propylthiouracil appears to have a prolonged radioprotective effect and should be stopped for a longer period before radioiodine is given, or a larger dose of radioiodine will be necessary. Efforts to calculate an optimal dose of radioiodine that achieves euthyroidism without a high incidence of relapse or progression to hypothyroidism have not been successful. Some patients inevitably relapse after a single dose because the biologic effects of radiation vary between individuals, and hypothyroidism cannot be uniformly avoided even using accurate dosimetry. A practical strategy is to give a fixed dose based on clinical features, such as the severity of thyrotoxicosis, the size of the goiter (increases the dose needed), and the level of radioiodine uptake (decreases the dose needed). 131I dosage generally ranges between 370 MBq (10 mCi) and 555 MBq (15 mCi). Most authorities favor an approach aimed at thyroid ablation (as opposed to euthyroidism), given that levothyroxine replacement is straightforward and most patients ultimately progress to hypothyroidism over 5–10 years, frequently with some delay in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Certain radiation safety precautions are necessary in the first few days after radioiodine treatment, but the exact guidelines vary depending on local protocols. In general, patients need to avoid close, prolonged contact with children and pregnant women for 5–7 days because of possible transmission of residual isotope and exposure to radiation emanating from the gland. Rarely, there may be mild pain due to radiation thyroiditis 1–2 weeks after treatment. Hyperthyroidism can persist for 2–3 months before radioiodine takes full effect. For this reason, β-adrenergic blockers or antithyroid drugs can be used to control symptoms during this interval. Persistent hyperthyroidism can be treated with a second dose of radioiodine, usually 6 months after the first dose. The risk of hypothyroidism after radioiodine depends on the dosage but is at least 10–20% in the first year and 5% per year thereafter. Patients should be informed of this possibility before treatment and require close follow-up during the first year followed by annual thyroid function testing. Pregnancy and breast-feeding are absolute contraindications to radioiodine treatment, but patients can conceive safely 6 months after treatment. The presence of severe ophthalmopathy requires caution, and some authorities advocate the use of prednisone, 40 mg/d, at the time of radioiodine treatment, tapered over 6–12 weeks to prevent exacerbation of ophthalmopathy. The overall risk of cancer after radioiodine treatment in adults is not increased. Although many physicians avoid radioiodine in children and adolescents because of the theoretical risks of malignancy, emerging evidence suggests that radioiodine can be used safely in older children. Subtotal or near-total thyroidectomy is an option for patients who relapse after antithyroid drugs and prefer this treatment to radioiodine. Some experts recommend surgery in young individuals, particularly when the goiter is very large. Careful control of thyrotoxicosis with antithyroid drugs, followed by potassium iodide (3 drops SSKI orally tid), is needed prior to surgery to avoid thyrotoxic crisis and to reduce the vascularity of the gland. The major complications of surgery—bleeding, laryngeal edema, hypoparathyroidism, and damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves—are unusual when the procedure is performed by highly experienced surgeons. Recurrence rates in the best series are <2%, but the rate of hypothyroidism is only slightly less than that following radioiodine treatment. The titration regimen of antithyroid drugs should be used to manage Graves’ disease in pregnancy because transplacental passage of these drugs may produce fetal hypothyroidism and goiter if the maternal dose is excessive. If available, propylthiouracil should be used in early gestation because of the association of rare cases of fetal aplasia cutis and other defects, such as choanal atresia with carbimazole and methimazole. As noted above, because of its rare association with hepatotoxicity, propylthiouracil should be limited to the first trimester and then maternal therapy should be converted to methimazole (or carbimazole) at a ratio of 15–20 mg of propylthiouracil to 1 mg of methimazole The lowest effective antithyroid drug dose should be used throughout gestation to maintain the maternal serum free T4 level at the upper limit of the nonpregnant normal reference range. It is often possible to stop treatment in the last trimester because TSIs tend to decline in pregnancy. Nonetheless, the transplacental transfer of these antibodies rarely causes fetal or neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Poor intrauterine growth, a fetal heart rate of >160 beats/min, and high levels of maternal TSI in the last trimester may herald this complication. Antithyroid drugs given to the mother can be used to treat the fetus and may be needed for 1–3 months after delivery, until the maternal antibodies disappear from the baby’s circulation. The postpartum period is a time of major risk for relapse of Graves’ disease. Breast-feeding is safe with low doses of antithyroid drugs. Graves’ disease in children is usually managed with methimazole or carbimazole (avoid propylthiouracil), often given as a prolonged 2297 course of the titration regimen. Surgery or radioiodine may be indicated for severe disease. Thyrotoxic crisis, or thyroid storm, is rare and presents as a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, accompanied by fever, delirium, seizures, coma, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice. The mortality rate due to cardiac failure, arrhythmia, or hyperthermia is as high as 30%, even with treatment. Thyrotoxic crisis is usually precipitated by acute illness (e.g., stroke, infection, trauma, diabetic ketoacidosis), surgery (especially on the thyroid), or radioiodine treatment of a patient with partially treated or untreated hyperthyroidism. Management requires intensive monitoring and supportive care, identification and treatment of the precipitating cause, and measures that reduce thyroid hormone synthesis. Large doses of propylthiouracil (500–1000 mg loading dose and 250 mg every 4 h) should be given orally or by nasogastric tube or per rectum; the drug’s inhibitory action on T4 → T3 conversion makes it the antithyroid drug of choice. If not available, methimazole can be used in doses up to 30 mg every 12 h. One hour after the first dose of propylthiouracil, stable iodide is given to block thyroid hormone synthesis via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect (the delay allows the antithyroid drug to prevent the excess iodine from being incorporated into new hormone). A saturated solution of potassium iodide (5 drops SSKI every 6 h) or, where available, ipodate or iopanoic acid (500 mg per 12 h) may be given orally.', 'Some cases have had a relapsing course over months or years. It is important to note that most have had normal thyroid function. There are in these cases, however, high titers of several antithyroid antibodies, particularly antibodies against thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin; some affected individuals have more than one such antibody. Ferracci and colleagues found evidence of the production of these antibodies in the nervous system and of their presence in spinal fluid. One must be cautious, however, in interpreting the presence of antithyroid antibodies in the blood, as they are detected in many people without an encephalopathy, particularly older women, and in two-thirds of patients with Graves disease.

","['Over half of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The majority of patients present with signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities that can be attributed to the primary lesion, local tumor growth, invasion or obstruction of adjacent structures, growth at distant metastatic sites, or a paraneoplastic syndrome (Tables 107-4 and 107-5). The prototypical lung cancer patient is a current or former smoker of either sex, usually in the seventh decade of life. A history of chronic cough with or without hemoptysis in a current or former smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) age 40 years or older should prompt a thorough investigation for lung cancer even in the face of a normal CXR. A persistent pneumonia without constitutional symptoms and unresponsive to repeated courses of antibiotics also should prompt an evaluation for the underlying cause. Lung cancer arising in a lifetime never smoker is more common in women and East Asians. Such patients also tend to be younger than their smoking counterparts at the time of diagnosis. The clinical presentation of lung cancer in never smokers tends to mirror that of current and former smokers. Patients with central or endobronchial growth of the primary tumor may present with cough, hemoptysis, wheeze, stridor, dyspnea, or postobstructive pneumonitis. Peripheral growth of the primary tumor may cause pain from pleural or chest wall involvement, dyspnea on a restrictive basis, and symptoms of a lung abscess resulting from tumor cavitation. Regional spread of tumor in the thorax (by contiguous growth or by metastasis to regional lymph nodes) may cause tracheal obstruction, esophageal compression with dysphagia, recurrent laryngeal paralysis with hoarseness, phrenic nerve palsy with elevation of the hemidiaphragm and dyspnea, and sympathetic nerve paralysis with Horner’s syndrome (enophthalmos, ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis). Malignant pleural effusions can cause pain, dyspnea, or cough. Pancoast (or superior sulcus tumor) syndromes result from local extension of a tumor growing in the apex of the lung with involvement of the eighth cervical and first and second thoracic nerves, and present with shoulder pain that characteristically radiates in the ulnar\n\n\n\nSymptom and Signs Range of Frequency\n\n\n\nSource: Reproduced with permission from MA Beckles: Chest 123:97-104, 2003.

Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise.', 'Thus, the diagnosis of kidney disease often surprises patients and may be a cause of skepticism and denial. Particular aspects of the history that are germane to renal disease include a history of hypertension (which can cause CKD or more commonly be a consequence of CKD), diabetes mellitus, abnormal urinalyses, and problems with pregnancy such as preeclampsia or early pregnancy loss. A careful drug history should be elicited: patients may not volunteer use of analgesics, for example. Other drugs to consider include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, antimicrobials, chemotherapeutic agents, antiretroviral agents, proton pump inhibitors, phosphate-containing bowel cathartics, and lithium. In evaluating the uremic syndrome, questions about appetite, weight loss, nausea, hiccups, peripheral edema, muscle cramps, pruritus, and restless legs are especially helpful. A careful family history of kidney disease, together with assessment of manifestations in other organ systems such as auditory, visual, and integumentary, may lead to the diagnosis of a heritable form of CKD (e.g., Alport or Fabry disease, cystinosis) or shared environmental exposure to nephrotoxic agents (e.g., heavy metals, aristolochic acid). It should be noted that clustering of CKD, sometimes of different etiologies, is often observed within families. The physical examination should focus on blood pressure and target organ damage from hypertension. Thus, funduscopy and precordial examination (left ventricular heave, a fourth heart sound) should be carried out. Funduscopy is important in the diabetic patient, because it may show evidence of diabetic retinopathy, which is associated with nephropathy. Other physical examination manifestations of CKD include edema and sensory polyneuropathy. The finding of asterixis or a pericardial friction rub not attributable to other causes usually signifies the presence of the uremic syndrome. Laboratory Investigation Laboratory studies should focus on a search for clues to an underlying causative or aggravating disease process and on the degree of renal damage and its consequences. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis, looking for multiple myeloma, should be obtained in all patients >35 years with unexplained CKD, especially if there is associated anemia and elevated, or even inappropriately 1820 normal, serum calcium concentration in the face of renal insufficiency. In the presence of glomerulonephritis, autoimmune diseases such as lupus and underlying infectious etiologies such as hepatitis B and C and HIV should be tested. Serial measurements of renal function should be obtained to determine the pace of renal deterioration and ensure that the disease is truly chronic rather than acute or subacute and hence potentially reversible. Serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and PTH should be measured to evaluate metabolic bone disease. Hemoglobin concentration, iron, vitamin B12, and folate should also be evaluated. A 24-h urine collection may be helpful, because protein excretion >300 mg may be an indication for therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Imaging Studies The most useful imaging study is a renal ultrasound, which can verify the presence of two kidneys, determine if they are symmetric, provide an estimate of kidney size, and rule out renal masses and evidence of obstruction. Because it takes time for kidneys to shrink as a result of chronic disease, the finding of bilaterally small kidneys supports the diagnosis of CKD of long-standing duration, with an irreversible component of scarring. If the kidney size is normal, it is possible that the renal disease is acute or subacute. The exceptions are diabetic nephropathy (where kidney size is increased at the onset of diabetic nephropathy before CKD supervenes), amyloidosis, and HIV nephropathy, where kidney size may be normal in the face of CKD. Polycystic kidney disease that has reached some degree of renal failure will almost always present with enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts (Chap. 339). A discrepancy >1 cm in kidney length suggests either a unilateral developmental abnormality or disease process or renovascular disease with arterial insufficiency affecting one kidney more than the other. The diagnosis of renovascular disease can be undertaken with different techniques, including Doppler sonography, nuclear medicine studies, or CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. If there is a suspicion of reflux nephropathy (recurrent childhood urinary tract infection, asymmetric renal size with scars on the renal poles), a voiding cystogram may be indicated. However, in most cases, by the time the patient has CKD, the reflux has resolved, and even if still present, repair does not improve renal function. Radiographic contrast imaging studies are not particularly helpful in the investigation of CKD. Intravenous or intraarterial dye should be avoided where possible in the CKD patient, especially with diabetic nephropathy, because of the risk of radiographic contrast dye–induced renal failure. When unavoidable, appropriate precautionary measures include avoidance of hypovolemia at the time of contrast exposure, minimization of the dye load, and choice of radiographic contrast preparations with the least nephrotoxic potential. Additional measures thought to attenuate contrast-induced worsening of renal function include judicious administration of sodium bicarbonate–containing solutions and N -acetylcysteine. Kidney Biopsy In the patient with bilaterally small kidneys, renal biopsy is not advised because (1) it is technically difficult and has a greater likelihood of causing bleeding and other adverse consequences, (2) there is usually so much scarring that the underlying disease may not be apparent, and (3) the window of opportunity to render disease-specific therapy has passed. Other contraindications to renal biopsy include uncontrolled hypertension, active urinary tract infection, bleeding diathesis (including ongoing anticoagulation), and severe obesity. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy is the favored approach, but a surgical or laparoscopic approach can be considered, especially in the patient with a single kidney where direct visualization and control of bleeding are crucial. In the CKD patient in whom a kidney biopsy is indicated (e.g., suspicion of a concomitant or superimposed active process such as interstitial nephritis or in the face of accelerated loss of GFR), the bleeding time should be measured, and if increased, desmopressin should be administered immediately prior to the procedure. A brief run of hemodialysis (without heparin) may also be considered prior to renal biopsy to normalize the bleeding time. The most important initial diagnostic step is to distinguish newly diagnosed CKD from acute or subacute renal failure, because the latter two conditions may respond to targeted therapy. Previous measurements of serum creatinine concentration are particularly helpful in this regard. Normal values from recent months or even years suggest that the current extent of renal dysfunction could be more acute, and hence reversible, than might otherwise be appreciated. In contrast, elevated serum creatinine concentration in the past suggests that the renal disease represents a chronic process. Even if there is evidence of chronicity, there is the possibility of a superimposed acute process (e.g., ECFV depletion, urinary infection or obstruction, or nephrotoxin exposure) supervening on the chronic condition. If the history suggests multiple systemic manifestations of recent onset (e.g., fever, polyarthritis, rash), it should be assumed that renal insufficiency is part of an acute systemic illness. Although renal biopsy can usually be performed in early CKD (stages 1–3), it is not always indicated. For example, in a patient with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus for 15–20 years with retinopathy, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and absence of hematuria, the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is very likely and biopsy is usually not necessary. However, if there were some other finding not typical of diabetic nephropathy, such as hematuria or white blood cell casts, or absence of diabetic retinopathy, some other disease may be present and a biopsy may be indicated. In the absence of a clinical diagnosis, renal biopsy may be the only recourse to establish an etiology in early-stage CKD. However, as noted above, once the CKD is advanced and the kidneys are small and scarred, there is little utility and significant risk in attempting to arrive at a specific diagnosis. Genetic testing is increasingly entering the repertoire of diagnostic tests, since the patterns of injury and kidney morphologic abnormalities often reflect overlapping causal mechanisms, whose origins can sometimes be attributed to a genetic predisposition or cause. Treatments aimed at specific causes of CKD are discussed elsewhere. Among others, these include optimized glucose control in diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive agents for glomerulonephritis, and emerging specific therapies to retard cystogenesis in polycystic kidney disease. The optimal timing of both specific and nonspecific therapy is usually well before there has been a measurable decline in GFR and certainly before CKD is established. It is helpful to measure sequentially and plot the rate of decline of GFR in all patients. Any acceleration in the rate of decline should prompt a search for superimposed acute or subacute processes that may be reversible. These include ECFV depletion, uncontrolled hypertension, urinary tract infection, new obstructive uropathy, exposure to nephrotoxic agents (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or radiographic dye), and reactivation or flare of the original disease, such as lupus or vasculitis. There is variation in the rate of decline of GFR among patients with CKD. However, the following interventions should be considered in an effort to stabilize or slow the decline of renal function. Reducing Intraglomerular Hypertension and Proteinuria Increased intraglomerular filtration pressures and glomerular hypertrophy develop as a response to loss of nephron number from different kidney diseases. This response is maladaptive, as it promotes the ongoing decline of kidney function even if the inciting process has been treated or spontaneously resolved. Control of glomerular hypertension is important in slowing the progression of CKD. Moreover, elevated blood pressure increases proteinuria by increasing its flux across the glomerular capillaries. Conversely, the renoprotective effect of antihypertensive medications is gauged through the consequent reduction of proteinuria. Thus, the more effective a given treatment is in lowering protein excretion, the greater the subsequent impact on protection from decline in GFR. This observation is the basis for the treatment guideline establishing 130/80 mmHg as the target blood pressure in proteinuric CKD patients. ACE inhibitors and ARBs inhibit the angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles of the glomerular microcirculation. This inhibition leads to a reduction in both intraglomerular filtration pressure and proteinuria. Several controlled studies have shown that these drugs are effective in slowing the progression of renal failure in patients with advanced stages of both diabetic and nondiabetic CKD. This slowing in progression of CKD is strongly associated with the proteinuria-lowering effect. In the absence of an antiproteinuric response with either agent alone, combined treatment with both ACE inhibitors and ARBs has been considered. The combination is associated with a greater reduction in proteinuria compared to either agent alone. Insofar as reduction in proteinuria is a surrogate for improved renal outcome, the combination would appear to be advantageous. However, there is a greater incidence of acute kidney injury and adverse cardiac events from such combination therapy. It is uncertain, therefore, whether the ACE inhibitor plus ARB therapy can be advised routinely. Adverse effects from these agents include cough and angioedema with ACE inhibitors and anaphylaxis and hyperkalemia with either class. A progressive increase in serum creatinine concentration with these agents may suggest the presence of renovascular disease within the large or small arteries. Development of these side effects may mandate the use of second-line antihypertensive agents instead of the ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Among the calcium channel blockers, diltiazem and verapamil may exhibit superior antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects compared to the dihydropyridines. At least two different categories of response can be considered: one in which progression is strongly associated with systemic and intraglomerular hypertension and proteinuria (e.g., diabetic nephropathy, glomerular diseases) and in which ACE inhibitors and ARBs are likely to be the first choice; and another in which proteinuria is mild or absent initially (e.g., adult polycystic kidney disease and other tubulointerstitial diseases), where the contribution of intraglomerular hypertension is less prominent and other antihypertensive agents can be useful for control of systemic hypertension.

Recurrent episodes lasting ≥ 2 weeks characterized by ≥ 5 of 9 diagnostic symptoms (must include depressed mood or anhedonia) (DIGS SPACE):\n\n\n\nGuilt or feelings of worthlessness\n\n\n\nScreen for previous manic or hypomanic episodes to rule out bipolar disorder. Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line. Also SNRIs, mirtazapine, bupropion, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Persistent depressive Often milder than MDD; ≥ 2 depressive symptoms lasting ≥ 2 years (≥ 1 year in children), with any disorder (dysthymia) remission lasting ≤ 2 months. MDD with seasonal Formerly called seasonal affective disorder. Major depressive episodes occurring only during a pattern particular season (usually winter) in ≥ 2 consecutive years and in most years across a lifetime. Atypical symptoms common. Depression with atypical features\n\n\n\nCharacterized by mood reactivity (transient improvement in response to a positive event), hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis (heavy feeling in arms and legs), long-standing interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Most common subtype of depression. Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line. MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are effective but not first line because of their risk profile. MDD with peripartum 10–15% incidence rate. Formerly called postpartum depression. Meets MDD criteria with onset no onset later than 1 year after delivery. Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line. Postpartum psychosis 0.1–0.2% incidence rate. Characterized by mood-congruent delusions, hallucinations, and thoughts of harming the baby or self. Risk factors include first pregnancy, family history, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, recent medication change. Treatment: hospitalization and initiation of atypical antipsychotic; if insufficient, ECT may be used. Grief The five stages of grief per the Kübler-Ross model are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance (may occur in any order). Other normal grief symptoms include shock, guilt, sadness, anxiety, yearning, and somatic symptoms that usually occur in waves. Simple hallucinations of the deceased person are common (eg, hearing the deceased speaking). Any thoughts of dying are limited to joining the deceased (vs complicated grief). Duration varies widely; usually resolves within 6–12 months. Persistent complex bereavement disorder involves obsessive preoccupation with the deceased and causes functional impairment, lasting at least 12 months (6 months in children). Can also meet criteria for major depressive episode.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Although suicidal and homicidal behaviors are absolute indications for referral, many physicians fear that questioning patients about these behaviors will provoke them.

"A 30-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 30 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department because of progressive upper abdominal pain for the past hour. The patient vomited once on her way to the hospital. She states that she initially had dull stomach pain about 6 hours ago, but now the pain is located in the upper abdomen and is more severe. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is sexually active with her husband. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Medications include folic acid and a multivitamin.

","['Abnormal vital signs provide diagnostic clues and determine the need for acute intervention. Fever suggests inflammation or neoplasm. Orthostasis is found with significant blood loss, dehydration, sepsis, or autonomic neuropathy. Skin, eye, or joint findings may point to specific diagnoses. Neck exam with swallowing assessment evaluates dysphagia. Cardiopulmonary disease may present with abdominal pain or nausea; thus lung and cardiac exams are important. Pelvic examination tests for a gynecologic source of abdominal pain. Rectal exam may detect blood, indicating gut mucosal injury or neoplasm or a palpable inflammatory mass in appendicitis. Metabolic conditions and gut motor disorders have associated peripheral neuropathy. Inspection of the abdomen may reveal distention from obstruction, tumor, or ascites or vascular abnormalities with liver disease. Ecchymoses develop with severe pancreatitis. Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers. Laboratory, radiographic, and functional tests can assist in diagnosis of suspected GI disease. The GI tract also is amenable to internal evaluation with upper and lower endoscopy and to examination of luminal contents. Histopathologic exams of GI tissues complement these tests. Laboratory Selected laboratory tests facilitate the diagnosis of GI disease. Iron-deficiency anemia suggests mucosal blood loss, whereas vitamin B12 deficiency results from small-intestinal, gastric, or pancreatic disease. Either also can result from inadequate oral intake. Leukocytosis and increased sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels are found in inflammatory conditions, whereas leukopenia is seen in viremic illness. Severe vomiting or diarrhea elicits electrolyte disturbances, acid-base abnormalities, and elevated blood urea nitrogen. Pancreaticobiliary or liver disease is suggested by elevated pancreatic or liver chemistries. Thyroid chemistries, cortisol, and calcium levels are obtained to exclude endocrinologic causes of GI symptoms. Pregnancy testing is considered for women with unexplained nausea. Serologic tests can screen for celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatologic diseases like lupus or scleroderma, and paraneoplastic dysmotility syndromes.', 'The problem of differential diagnosis is often not readily resolved. The pain of porphyria and of lead colic is usually difficult to distinguish from that of intestinal obstruction, because severe hyperperistalsis is a prominent feature of both. The pain of uremia or diabetes is nonspecific, and the pain and tenderness frequently shift in location and intensity. Diabetic acidosis may be precipitated by acute appendicitis or intestinal obstruction, so if prompt resolution of the abdominal pain does not result from correction of the metabolic abnormalities, an underlying organic problem should be suspected. Black widow spider bites produce intense pain and rigidity of the abdominal muscles and 105 back, an area infrequently involved in intraabdominal disease. Evaluating and diagnosing causes of abdominal pain in immunosuppressed or otherwise immunocompromised patients is very difficult. This includes those who have undergone organ transplantation; who are receiving immunosuppressive treatments for autoimmune diseases, chemotherapy, or glucocorticoids; who have AIDS; and who are very old. In these circumstances, normal physiologic responses may be absent or masked. In addition, unusual infections may cause abdominal pain where the etiologic agents include cytomegalovirus, mycobacteria, protozoa, and fungi. These pathogens may affect all gastrointestinal organs, including the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas, as well as the gastrointestinal tract, causing occult or overtly symptomatic perforations of the latter. Splenic abscesses due to Candida or Salmonella infection should also be considered, especially when evaluating patients with left upper quadrant or left flank pain. Acalculous cholecystitis is a relative common complication in patients with AIDS, where it is often associated with cryptosporidiosis or cytomegalovirus infection. Neutropenic enterocolitis is often identified as a cause of abdominal pain and fever in some patients with bone marrow suppression due to chemotherapy. Acute graft-versus-host disease should be considered.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Fever and cough suggest pneumonia.\n\n\n\nHematuria, pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness point to a GU etiology.\n\n\n\nIf associated with meals, consider mesenteric ischemia, PUD, biliary disease, pancreatitis, or bowel pathology.\n\n\n\nA family history of abdominal pain may indicate familial Mediterranean fever or acute intermittent porphyria.\n\n\n\nIf peritoneal signs, shock, or impending shock is present, emergent exploratory laparotomy is necessary.

","['The lower extremities are most commonly affected. Clinical manifestations depend on the vessels involved, the extent and rate of obstruction, and the presence of collateral blood ﬂ ow. Presents with intermittent claudication (reproducible leg pain that occurs with walking and is always relieved with rest). As the disease progresses, pain occurs at rest and affects the distal extremities. Dorsal foot ulcerations may develop 2° to poor perfusion. A painful, cold, numb foot is characteristic of critical limb ischemia. Aortoiliac disease: Associated with Leriche’s syndrome (buttock claudication, ↓ femoral pulses, male impotence). Femoropopliteal disease: Calf claudication; pulses below the femoral artery are absent. Acute ischemia: Most often caused by embolization from the heart; acute occlusions commonly occur at bifurcations distal to the last palpable pulse. May also be 2° to cholesterol atheroembolism (“blue toe syndrome”). ■Severe chronic ischemia: Lack of blood perfusion leads to muscle atrophy, pallor, cyanosis, hair loss, and gangrene/necrosis. Carefully palpate pulses and auscultate for bruits. Measurement of ankle and brachial systolic BP (ankle-brachial index, or ABI) can provide objective evidence of atherosclerosis (rest pain usually occurs with an ABI < 0.4). A high ABI can indicate calcification of the arteries. Doppler ultrasound helps identify stenosis and occlusion. Doppler ankle systolic pressure readings that are > 90% of brachial readings are normal. Arteriography and digital subtraction angiography are necessary for surgical evaluation. Control underlying conditions (e.g., DM, other cardiac risk factors); eliminate tobacco and institute careful hygiene and foot care. Exercise helps develop collateral circulation. ASA, cilostazol, and thromboxane inhibitors may improve symptoms; anticoagulants may prevent clot formation. Angioplasty and stenting have a variable success rate that is dependent on the area of occlusion. Surgery (arterial bypass) or amputation can be employed when conservation treatment fails. Avoid β-blockers in peripheral arterial disease 2° to B2-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction. Disruption of the lymphatic circulation that results in peripheral edema and chronic infection of the extremities. Often a complication of surgery involving lymph node dissection. In underdeveloped countries, parasitic infection can lead to lymphatic obstruction, resulting in edema. Congenital malformations of the lymphatic system, such as Milroy’s disease, can present with lymphedema in childhood. Postmastectomy patients present with unexplained swelling of the upper extremity. Immigrants present with progressive swelling of the lower extremities bilaterally with no cardiac abnormalities (i.e., filariasis). Children present with progressive, bilateral swelling of the extremities. Diagnosis is clinical. Rule out other causes of edema, such as cardiac and metabolic disorders. Directed at symptom management, as no curative treatment exists. Agents such as diuretics are ineffective and relatively contraindicated. Exercise, massage therapy, and pressure garments to mobilize and limit ﬂuid accumulation may be of help. ■Maintain vigilance for cellulitis with prompt gram-antibiotic coverage for infection. Cardiac syncope is associated with one-year sudden cardiac death rates of up to 40%. A sudden, temporary loss of consciousness and postural tone 2° to cerebral hypoperfusion. Etiologies are either cardiac or noncardiac:\n\n\n\nCardiac: Valvular lesions, arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, aortic dissection. Noncardiac: Orthostatic/hypovolemic hypotension, neurologic (TIA, stroke), metabolic abnormalities, neurocardiogenic syndromes (e.g., vasovagal/micturition syncope), psychiatric. Rule out many potential etiologies. Triggers, prodromal symptoms, and associated symptoms should be investigated. Cardiac causes of syncope are typically associated with very brief or absent prodromal symptoms, a history of exertion, lack of association with changes in position, and/or a history of cardiac disease. Depending on the suspected etiology, Holter monitors or event recorders (arrhythmias), echocardiograms (structural abnormalities), and stress tests (ischemia) can be useful diagnostic tools.', 'This disorder may be caused by stenoses (narrowing) and/or occlusions (blockages) in the lower aorta and the iliac, femoral, tibial, and fibular vessels. Patients typically have chronic leg ischemia and “acute on chronic” leg ischemia. Chronic leg ischemia is a disorder in which vessels have undergone atheromatous change, and often there is significant luminal narrowing (usually over 50%). Most patients with peripheral arterial disease have widespread arterial disease (including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease), which may be clinically asymptomatic. Some of these patients develop such severe ischemia that the viability of the limb is threatened (critical limb ischemia). The commonest symptom of chronic leg ischemia is intermittent claudication. Patients typically have a history of pain that develops in the calf muscles (usually associated with occlusions or narrowing in the femoral artery) or the buttocks (usually associated with occlusion or narrowing in the aorto-iliac segments). The pain experienced in these muscles is often cramplike and occurs with walking. The patient rests and is able to continue walking up to the same distance until the pain recurs and stops walking as before. In some patients with chronic limb ischemia, an acute event blocks the vessels or reduces the blood supply to such a degree that the viability of the limb is threatened. Occasionally a leg may become acutely ischemic with no evidence of underlying atheromatous disease. In these instances a blood clot is likely to have embolized from the heart. Patients with mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation are prone to embolic disease. Critical limb ischemia occurs when the blood supply to the limb is so poor that the viability of the limb is severely threatened, and in this case many patients develop gangrene, ulceration, and severe rest pain in the foot. These patients require urgent treatment, which may be in the form of surgical reconstruction, radiological angioplasty, or even amputation. In the clinic\n\n\n\nMenisci can get torn during forceful rotation or twisting of the knee, but significant trauma is not always necessary for a tear to occur. There are various patterns of meniscal tearing depending on the cleavage plane such as vertical tears (perpendicular to the tibial plateau), horizontal tears (parallel to the long axis of the meniscus and perpendicular to the tibial plateau), or bucket handle tears (longitudinal tear where the torn portion of the meniscus forms a handle shaped fragment which gets displaced into the intercondylar notch). The patient usually complains of pain localized to the medial or lateral side of the knee, knee locking or clicking, sensation of knee giving way, and swelling, which can be intermittent and usually delayed. MRI is the modality of choice to assess meniscal tears and detect other associated injuries, such as ligamentous tears and articular cartilage damage (Fig. 6.74A). Arthroscopy is usually performed to repair a tear, debride the damaged meniscal material, or rarely remove the entire torn meniscus (Fig. 6.74B). In the clinic\n\n\n\nThe collateral ligaments are responsible for stabilizing the knee joint, controlling its sideway movements, and protecting the knee from excessive motion. Injury to the fibular collateral ligament occurs when excessive outward force is applied to the medial side of the knee (varus force), and is less common than an injury to the tibial collateral ligament that is damaged when excessive force is applied inward to the lateral side of the joint (valgus force). Injuries to the tibial collateral ligament can be part of a so called “unhappy triad” that also involves tears of the medial meniscus and the anterior cruciate ligament. The spectrum of injuries to collateral ligaments of the knee range from minor sprains where the ligaments are slightly stretched, but still able to stabilize the knee joint, to full thickness tears where all fibers are torn and the ligaments lose their stabilizing function. In the clinic\n\n\n\nThe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is most frequently injured during non-contact activities when there is a sudden change in the direction of movement (cutting or pivoting) (Fig. 6.81). Contact sports may also result in ACL injury due to sudden twisting, hyperextension, and valgus force related to direct collision. The injury usually affects the mid-portion of the ligament and manifests itself as a complete or partial discontinuity of the fibers or abnormal orientation and contour of the ligament. With an acute ACL tear, a sudden click or pop can be heard and the knee becomes rapidly swollen. Several tests are used to clinically assess the injury, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed by MRI. A full thickness ACL tear causes instability of the knee joint. The treatment depends on the desired level of activity of the patient. In those with high activity levels, surgical reconstruction of the ligament is required. Those with low activity levels may opt for knee bracing and physiotherapy; however, in the long term the internal damage to the knee leads to the development of early osteoarthritis. A tear to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) requires significant force, so it rarely occurs in isolation. It usually occurs during hyperextension of the knee or as a result of a direct blow to a bent knee such as when striking the knee against the dashboard in a motor vehicle accident. Typically, the injury presents as posterior displacement of the tibia on physical examination (the so called tibial sag sign). Patients complain of knee pain and swelling, inability to bear weight, and instability. The diagnosis is confirmed on MRI. The management, as in ACL injury, depends on the degree of the injury (sprain, partial thickness, full thickness) and the level of desired activity. In the clinic\n\n\n\nDegenerative joint disease occurs throughout many joints within the body. Articular degeneration may result from an abnormal force across the joint with a normal cartilage or a normal force with abnormal cartilage. Typically degenerative joint disease occurs in synovial joints and the process is called osteoarthritis. In the joints where osteoarthritis occurs the cartilage and bony tissues are usually involved, with limited change within the synovial membrane. The typical findings include reduction in the joint space, eburnation (joint sclerosis), osteophytosis (small bony outgrowths), and bony cyst formation. As the disease progresses the joint may become malaligned, its movement may become severely limited, and there may be significant pain. The commonest sites for osteoarthritis include the small joints of the hands and wrist, and in the lower limb, the hip and knee are typically affected, though the tarsometatarsal and metatarsophalangeal articulations may undergo similar changes. The etiology of degenerative joint disease is unclear, but there are some associations, including genetic predisposition, increasing age (males tend to be affected younger than females), overuse or underuse of joints, and nutritional and metabolic abnormalities. Further factors include joint trauma and pre-existing articular disease or deformity. The histological findings of osteoarthritis consist of degenerative changes within the cartilage and the subchondral bone. Further articular damage worsens these changes, which promote further abnormal stresses upon the joint. As the disease progresses the typical finding is pain, which is usually worse on rising from bed and at the end of a day’s activity. Commonly it is aggravated by the extremes of movement or unaccustomed exertion. Stiffness and limitation of movement may ensue.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['DESCRIPTIONOBJECTIVE CRITERIA00Asymptomatic—no hemodynamically significant occlusive diseaseNormal treadmill or reactive hyperemia test\xa01Mild claudicationAble to complete treadmill exercisea; AP after exercise \u2002>50 mmHg but at least 20 mmHg lower than resting valueI2Moderate claudicationBetween categories 1 and 3\xa03Severe claudicationCannot complete standard treadmill exercisea and AP after exercise <50 mmHgIIb4Ischemic rest painResting AP <40 mmHg, flat or barely pulsatile ankle or metatarsal PVR; TP <30 mmHgIIIb5Minor tissue loss—nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene with diffuse pedal ischemiaResting AP <60 mmHg, ankle or metatarsal PVR flat or barely pulsatile; TP <40 mmHg\xa06Major tissue loss—extending above TM level, functional foot no longer salvageableSame as category 5aFive minutes at 2 miles per hour on a 12% incline of treadmill exercise.bGrades II and III, categories 4, 5, and 6, are encompassed by the term chronic critical ischemia.AP = ankle pressure; PVR = pulse volume', 'poorly fitting shoes.

As with all vascular patients, it is important to evaluate their risk factors, intercurrent cardiac diseases, and any prior vascular interventions.Treatment Considerations for Chronic  Limb IschemiaPatients with vascular diseases frequently have complicated medical comorbidities. Careful patient evaluation and selection should be performed for any peripheral arterial vascular proce-dure. The fundamental principle is to assess not only the surgi-cal risk from the peripheral arterial system but also the global nature of the atherosclerotic process. Full cardiac evaluations are often necessary due to the high incidence of concomitant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, resulting in a high risk for ischemic events.

In contrast to diuretics, the effect of digitalis or arterial vasodilator therapy in a patient with heart failure is movement onto another ventricular function curve intermediate between the normal and the depressed curves. When the patient’s ventricular function moves from A to B by the administration of one of these agents, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure may also decrease because of improved cardiac function; further administration of diuretics or venodilators may shift the function further to the left along the same curve from B to C and eliminate the risk of pulmonary edema. A vasodilating agent that has arteriolar and venous dilating properties (e.g., nitroprusside) would shift this function directly from A to C. If this agent shifts the function from A to D because of excessive venodilation or administration of diuretics, the cardiac output may decrease too much, even though the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure would be normal (10 mm Hg) for a normal heart. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressures of 15 to 18 mm Hg are usually optimal in the failing heart to maximize cardiac output, but to avoid pulmonary edema. (From Andreoli TE, Carpenter CCJ, Griggs RC, Loscalzo J, editors: Cecil essentials of medicine, ed 5, Philadelphia, Saunders, 2001.) pulmonary edema. Echocardiographyshows the small left side of the heart, the degree of stenosis of theaortic and mitral valves, the hypoplastic ascending aorta, and the adequacy of left-to-right atrial flow and right-to-left ductal flow. Medical management includes prostaglandin E1 to open the ductus arteriosus, correction of acidosis, and ventilatory and blood pressure support as needed. Surgical repair is stagedwith the first surgery (Norwood procedure) done in the newborn period. Subsequent procedures create a systemic source for the pulmonary circulation (bidirectional Glenn and Fontan procedures), leaving the right ventricle to supply systemic circulation. There have been many modifications to all three stages of the repair. Prognosis for survival has improved significantly over the past two decades. Extracardiac complications are summarized in Table 144-2. The force generated by the cardiac muscle fiber depends onits contractile status and basal length, which is equivalent to the preload. As the preload (fiber length, left ventricular filling pressure, or volume) increases, myocardial performance(stroke volume and wall tension) increases up to a point (thenormal Starling curve). The relationship is the ventricular function curve (Fig. 145-1). Alterations in the contractilestate of the muscle lower the relative position of the curve,but retain the relationship of fiber length to muscle work.Heart rate is another important determinant of cardiac work because the cardiac output equals stroke volume times theheart rate. Additional factors also affect cardiac performance(Table 145-1). Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood at a rate commensurate with metabolic needs (oxygen delivery). It may be due to a change in myocardial contractility that results in low cardiac output or to abnormal loading conditions being placed on the myocardium. The abnormal loading conditions may be afterload (pressure overload, such as with aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, or coarctation of the aorta) or preload (volume overload, such as in ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), or valvular insufficiency. Volume overload is the most common cause of heart failure in children. The age of presentation is helpful in creating the differential diagnosis (Table 145-2). In the first weeks of life, excessive afterload being placed on the myocardium is most common. Heart failure presenting around 2 months of age is usually due to increasing left-to-right shunts that become apparent as the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. Acquired heart disease, such as myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, can present at any age.

Spironolactoneis usually added to the medical regimen because of its effecton cardiac remodeling. Although uncommon in the United States, acute rheumatic fever remains an important preventable cause of cardiac disease. It is most common in children 6 to 15 years of age. It is due to an immunologic reaction that is a delayed sequela of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections of the pharynx. A family history of rheumatic fever and lower socioeconomic status are additional factors. Available @ StudentConsult.com\n\n\n\nAcute rheumatic fever is diagnosed using the clinical and laboratory findings of the revised Jones criteria (Table 146-1).The presence of either two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria, along with evidence of an antecedent streptococcal infection, confirm a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever. The infection often precedes the presentation of rheumatic fever by 2 to 6 weeks. Streptococcal antibody tests, such as the antistreptolysin O titer, are the most reliable laboratory evidence of prior infection.

Death and poor outcome often are related not to failure of antibiotic therapy but rather to the interactions of comorbidities and endocarditis-related end-organ complications. In developed countries, overall survival rates are 80–85%; however, rates vary considerably among subpopulations of endocarditis patients. Survival rates for patients with NVE caused by viridans streptococci, HACEK organisms, or enterococci (susceptible to synergistic therapy) are 85–90%. For S. aureus NVE in patients who do not inject drugs, survival rates are 55–70%, whereas 85–90% of injection drug users survive this infection. PVE beginning within 2 months of valve replacement results in mortality rates of 40–50%, whereas rates are only 10–20% in later-onset cases. To prevent endocarditis (long a goal in clinical practice), past expert committees have supported systemic antibiotic administration prior to many bacteremia-inducing procedures.

","['Glycogen may aggregate to form structures recognizable by electron microscopy. With the exception of type 0 disease, defects in glycogen metabolism typically cause an accumulation of glycogen in the tissues—hence the designation glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). The structure of stored glycogen can be normal or abnormal in the various disorders. Defects in gluconeogenesis or glycolytic pathways, including galactose and fructose metabolism, usually do not result in glycogen accumulation. Clinical manifestations of the various disorders of carbohydrate metabolism differ markedly. The symptoms range from harmless to lethal. Unlike disorders of lipid metabolism, mucopolysaccharidoses, or other storage diseases, many carbohydrate disorders have been effectively managed with dietary therapy. All of the genes responsible for inherited defects of carbohydrate metabolism have been cloned, and mutations have been identified. Advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases are being used to improve diagnosis and management. Some of these disorders are candidates for enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, and early trials of gene therapy. Historically, the GSDs were categorized numerically in the order in which the enzymatic defects were identified. They are also classified by the organs involved (liver, muscle, and/or heart) and clinical manifestations. The latter is the system followed in this chapter (Table 433e-1). The overall frequency of all forms of GSD is ~1 in 20,000 live births. Most are inherited as autosomal recessive traits; however, phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency—one form of liver phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency—and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) deficiency are X-linked disorders. The most common childhood disorders are glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (type I), lysosomal acid α-glucosidase deficiency (type II), debrancher deficiency (type III), and liver PhK deficiency (type IX). The most common adult disorder is myophosphorylase deficiency (type V, or McArdle disease).

Storage in solid organs results in organomegaly. In many of these disorders, developmental delay, corneal clouding, and limitation of joint mobility are common features. Storage in tissues of the upper and lower airways may result in respiratory compromise. Non-immune hydrops fetalis occurs in several lysosomal disorders. Diagnostic testing includes measurement of glycosaminoglycans in urine and specific assays for lysosomal enzyme activity in white blood cells. If the urine test is positive, it helps direct specific enzyme measurement. If it is negative, it does not exclude a lysosomal storage disorder, and other testing modalities are needed if clinical signs are convincing. In disorders in which specific mutations are known, molecular testing refines the diagnosis. Specific diagnosis, carrier testing, and evaluation of at-risk family members require one of these approaches. Making a specific diagnosis is assuming increasing importance because specific treatment for some lysosomal disorders is very effective. Specific treatment directed at the metabolic abnormality isavailable for some lysosomal disorders. In specific disorders (Gaucher disease) oral medication may be successfulin reducing the accumulation of the metabolite that cannotbe catabolized. For some disorders, bone marrow (stem cell)transplantation can restore lysosomal function. For others, replacement of the missing hydrolytic enzyme by systemic administration of the enzyme allows degradation of stored material. The disorders caused by deficient α-l-iduronidase (Hurler syndrome, Scheie syndrome, and theirvariants) respond to treatment with intravenous humanrecombinant α-l-iduronidase (laronidase). Other disorders for which enzyme therapy is available include MPS VI(Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome), Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and MPS II (Hunter syndrome). Stem cell transplantation has been helpful or is under investigation in the followingdisorders: MPS type IH (Hurler syndrome), MPS type VI(Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome), MPS type VII (Sly syndrome),Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, alpha-fucosidosis, alpha-mannosidosis, Gaucher disease, and Nie-mann-Pick disease type B. However, treatment for many ofthese conditions is supportive, with careful attention to respiratory status and physical therapy.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['VI. GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASES\n\n\n\nGSD are a group of genetic diseases caused by defects in enzymes required for glycogen degradation or, more rarely, glycogen synthesis. They result either in formation of glycogen that has an abnormal structure or in the accumulation of excessive amounts of normal glycogen in specific tissues as a result of impaired degradation. A particular enzyme may be defective in a single tissue, such as the liver (resulting in hypoglycemia) or muscle (causing muscle weakness), or the defect may be more generalized, affecting a variety of tissues, such as the heart and kidneys. Severity ranges from fatal in early childhood to mild disorders that are not life threatening. Some of the more prevalent GSD are illustrated in Figure 11.8. [Note: Only GSD II is lysosomal because glycogen metabolism occurs primarily in the cytosol.]\n\n\n\nVII. CHAPTER SUMMARY', 'An inherited deficiency of any one of the enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis or degradation can result in excessive accumulation of glycogen or some abnormal form of glycogen in various tissues. The type of glycogen stored, its intracellular location, and the tissue distribution of the affected cells vary depending on the specific enzyme deficiency. Regardless of the tissue or cells affected, the glycogen most often is stored within the cytoplasm, or sometimes within nuclei. One variant, Pompe disease, is a form of lysosomal storage disease, because the missing enzyme is localized to lysosomes. Most glycogenoses are inherited as autosomal recessive diseases, as is common with “missing enzyme” syndromes.\n\n\n\nApproximately a dozen forms of glycogenoses have been described in association with specific enzyme deficiencies. Based on pathophysiologic findings, they can be grouped into three categories (\n\n\n\nTable 7.4']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0

Promotion of salivary secretion with mints or lemon drops may flush out small stones. Antibiotic treatment is necessary when bacterial infection in suspected. In adults, acute bacterial parotitis is typically unilateral and most commonly affects postoperative, dehydrated, and debilitated patients. Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and anaerobic bacteria are the most common pathogens. Chronic bacterial sialadenitis results from lowered salivary secretion and recurrent bacterial infection. When suspected bacterial infection is not responsive to therapy, the differential diagnosis should be expanded to include benign and malignant neoplasms, lymphoproliferative disorders, Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, lymphadenitis, actinomycosis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Bilateral nontender parotid enlargement occurs with diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, bulimia, HIV/AIDS, and drugs (e.g., iodide, propylthiouracil). Pleomorphic adenoma comprises two-thirds of all salivary neoplasms. The parotid is the principal salivary gland affected, and the tumor presents as a firm, slow-growing mass.

","['The patient is then instructed to walk for 5 min. A patent deep venous system and competent perforating veins enable the superficial veins below the tourniquet to collapse. Deep venous obstruction is likely to be present if the superficial veins distend further with walking. Differential Diagnosis The duration of leg edema helps to distinguish chronic venous insufficiency from acute deep vein thrombosis. Lymphedema, as discussed later in this chapter, is often confused with chronic venous insufficiency, and both may occur together. Other disorders that cause leg swelling should be considered and excluded when evaluating a patient with presumed venous insufficiency. Bilateral leg swelling occurs in patients with congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome or severe hepatic disease, myxedema caused by hypothyroidism or pretibial myxedema associated with Graves’ disease, and with drugs such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and thiazolidinediones. Unilateral causes of leg swelling also include ruptured leg muscles, hematomas secondary to trauma, and popliteal cysts. Cellulitis may cause erythema and swelling of the affected limb. Leg ulcers may be caused by severe peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia; neuropathies, particularly those associated with diabetes; and less commonly, skin cancer, vasculitis, or rarely as a complication of hydroxyurea. The location and characteristics of venous ulcers help to differentiate these from other causes. Classification of Chronic Venous Disease The CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) classification schema incorporates the range of symptoms and signs of chronic venous disease to characterize its severity. It also broadly categorizes the etiology as congenital, primary, or secondary; identifies the affected veins as superficial, deep, or perforating; and characterizes the pathophysiology as reflux, obstruction, both, or neither (Table 303-1). Diagnostic Testing The principal diagnostic test to evaluate patients with chronic venous disease is venous duplex ultrasonography. A venous duplex ultrasound examination uses a combination of B-mode imaging and spectral Doppler to detect the presence of venous obstruction and venous reflux in superficial and deep veins. Color-assisted Doppler ultrasound is useful to visualize venous flow patterns. Obstruction may be diagnosed by absence of flow, the presence of an echogenic thrombus within the vein, or failure of the vein to collapse when a compression maneuver is applied by the sonographer, the last implicating the presence of an intraluminal thrombus. Venous reflux is detected by prolonged reversal of venous flow direction during a Valsalva maneuver, particularly for the common femoral vein or saphenofemoral junction, or after compression and release of a cuff placed on the limb distal to the area being interrogated. Some vascular laboratories use air or strange gauge plethysmography to assess the severity of venous reflux and complement findings from the venous ultrasound examination. Venous volume and venous refilling time are measured when the legs are placed in a dependent position and after calf exercise to quantify the severity of venous reflux and the efficiency of the calf muscle pump to affect venous return. Magnetic resonance, computed tomographic, and conventional venography are rarely required to determine the cause and plan treatment for chronic venous insufficiency unless there is suspicion for pathology that might warrant intervention. These modalities are used to identify obstruction or stenosis of the inferior vena cava and iliofemoral veins, as may occur in patients with previous proximal\n\n\n\nTABlE 303-1 CEAP (CliniCAl, ETiologiC, AnAToMiC, PATHoPHYSiologiC) ClASSiFiCATion\n\n\n\nC0 No visible or palpable signs of venous disease C1 Telangiectasias, reticular veins C2 Varicose veins C3 Edema without skin changes C4 Skin changes, including pigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, and\n\n\n\nPr Reflux Po Obstruction Pr,o Reflux and obstruction Pn No venous pathophysiology identifiable\n\n\n\nSource: B Eklöf et al: J Vasc Surg 40:1248, 2004. deep vein thrombosis; occlusion of inferior vena cava filters; extrinsic compression from tumors; and May-Thurner syndrome. Varicose veins usually are treated with conservative measures. Symptoms often decrease when the legs are elevated periodically, prolonged standing is avoided, and elastic support hose are worn. External compression with elastic stockings or stretch bandages provides a counterbalance to the hydrostatic pressure in the veins. Although compression garments may improve symptoms, they do not prevent progression of varicose veins. Graduated compression stockings with pressures of 20–30 mmHg are suitable for most patients with simple varicose veins, although pressures of 30–40 mmHg may be required for patients with manifestations of venous insufficiency such as edema and ulcers. Patients with chronic venous insufficiency also should be advised to avoid prolonged standing or sitting; frequent leg elevation is helpful. Graded compression therapy consisting of stockings or multilayered compression bandages is the standard of care for advanced chronic venous insufficiency characterized by edema, skin changes, or venous ulcers defined as CEAP clinical class C3– C6. Graduated compression stockings of 30–40 mmHg are more effective than lesser grades for healing venous ulcers. The length of stocking depends on the distribution of edema. Calf-length stockings are tolerated better by most patients, particularly elderly patients; for patients with varicose veins or edema extending to the thigh, thigh-length stockings or panty hose should be considered.

While inherited thrombocytopenia is rare, any prior platelet counts should be retrieved and a family history regarding thrombocytopenia obtained. A careful history of drug ingestion should be obtained, including nonprescription and herbal remedies, because drugs are the most common cause of thrombocytopenia.

","['However, 25% of patients may be asymptomatic. Physical Signs Hepatomegaly is the most common physical sign, occurring in 50–90% of the patients. Abdominal bruits are noted in 6–25%, and ascites occurs in 30–60% of patients. Ascites should be examined by cytology. Splenomegaly is mainly due to portal hypertension. Weight loss and muscle wasting are common, particularly with rapidly growing or large tumors. Fever is found in 10–50% of patients, from unclear cause. The signs of chronic liver disease may often be present, including jaundice, dilated abdominal veins, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and peripheral edema. Budd-Chiari syndrome can occur due to HCC invasion of the hepatic veins, with tense ascites and a large tender liver (Chap. 365). Paraneoplastic Syndromes Most paraneoplastic syndromes in HCC are biochemical abnormalities without associated clinical consequences. They include hypoglycemia (also caused by end-stage liver failure), erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, hypercholesterolemia, dysfibrinogenemia, carcinoid syndrome, increased thyroxin-binding globulin, changes in secondary sex characteristics (gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and precocious puberty), and porphyria cutanea tarda. Mild hypoglycemia occurs in rapidly growing HCC as part of\n\n\n\nTumors of the Liver and Biliary Tree 546 terminal illness, and profound hypoglycemia may occur, although the cause is unclear. Erythrocytosis occurs in 3–12% of patients and hypercholesterolemia in 10–40%. A high percentage of patients have thrombocytopenia associated with their fibrosis or leukopenia, resulting from portal hypertension, and not from cancer infiltration of bone marrow, as in other tumor types. Furthermore, large HCCs have normal or high platelet levels (thrombocytosis), as in ovarian and other gastrointestinal cancers, probably related to elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels. Multiple clinical staging systems for HCC have been described. A widely used one has been the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification. However, the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) system is now popular because it takes cirrhosis into account, based on the original Okuda system (Table 111-4). Patients with Okuda stage III disease have a dire prognosis because they usually cannot be curatively resected, and the condition of their liver typically precludes chemotherapy. Other staging systems have been proposed, and a consensus is needed. They are all based on combining the prognostic features of liver damage with those of tumor aggressiveness and include the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system from Spain (Fig. 111-1), which is externally validated and incorporates baseline survival estimates; the Chinese University Prognostic Index (CUPI); the important and simple Japan Integrated Staging Score (JIS); and SLiDe, which stands for s tage, li ver damage, and de s-γ-carboxy prothrombin. CLIP and BCLC appear most popular in the West, whereas JIS is favored in Japan.', 'The clinical manifestations of S. haematobium infection occur relatively early and involve a high percentage of infected individuals. Up to 80% of children infected with S. haematobium have dysuria, frequency, and hematuria. Hematuria may sometimes occur only at the end of voiding. Urine examination reveals blood and albumin as well as an unusually high frequency of bacterial urinary tract infections and urinary sediment cellular metaplasia. These manifestations correlate with the intensity of infection, the presence of urinary bladder granulomas, and subsequent ulceration. Along with local effects of granuloma formation in the urinary bladder, obstruction of the lower end of the ureters results in hydroureter and hydronephrosis, which may be seen in 25–50% of infected children. As infection progresses, bladder granulomas undergo fibrosis, which results in typical sandy patches visible on cystoscopy. In many endemic areas, an association between squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder and S. haematobium infection has been observed. Such malignancy is detected in a younger age group than is transitional cell carcinoma. In fact, S. haematobium has now been classified as a human carcinogen. Genital schistosomiasis (described in the previous section) is a common presenting symptom among adults of both sexes. Significant disease may occur in other organs during chronic schistosomiasis. Lung and CNS disease have been documented; other sites, such as the skin and the genital organs, are less frequently affected. In pulmonary schistosomiasis, embolized eggs lodge in small arterioles, producing acute necrotizing arteriolitis and granuloma formation. During S. mansoni and S. japonicum infection, schistosome eggs reach the lungs after the development of portosystemic collateral circulation; in S. haematobium infection, ova may reach the lungs directly via connections between the vesical and systemic circulation. Subsequent fibrous tissue deposition leads to endarteritis obliterans, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale. The most common symptoms are cough, fever, and dyspnea. Cor pulmonale may be diagnosed radiologically on the basis of prominence of the right side of the heart and dilation of the pulmonary artery. Frank evidence of right-sided heart failure may be seen in late cases. Although less common than pulmonary manifestations, CNS 1427 schistosomiasis is important, characteristically occurring in association with S. japonicum infection. Migratory worms deposit eggs in the brain and induce a granulomatous response.

Nausea, sometimes with vomiting, and diarrhea can be manifestations of an SLE flare, as can diffuse abdominal pain probably caused by autoimmune peritonitis and/or intestinal vasculitis. Increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are common when SLE is active. These manifestations usually improve promptly during systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Vasculitis involving the intestine may be life-threatening; perforations, ischemia, bleeding, and sepsis are frequent complications. Aggressive immunosuppressive therapy with high-doseglucocorticoidsis recommendedfor short-term control;evidenceofrecurrenceis anindicationforadditionaltherapies. Siccasyndrome(Sjögren’ssyndrome; Chap. 383)andnonspecificconjunctivitis are common in SLE and rarely threaten vision. In contrast, retinal vasculitis and optic neuritis are serious manifestations: blindness can develop over days to weeks. Aggressive immunosuppression is recommended, although there arenocontrolledtrialstoprove effectiveness. Complications of systemic and intraorbital glucocorticoid therapy include cataracts (common) and glaucoma. Laboratory tests serve (1) to establish or rule out the diagnosis; (2) to followthe courseof disease,particularly to suggest that a flare is occurring or organ damage is developing; and (3) to identify adverse effects of therapies. Diagnostically, the most important autoantibodies to detect are ANA because the test is positive in >95% of patients, usually at the onset of symptoms. A few patients develop ANA within 1 year of symptom onset; repeated testing may thus be useful. ANA tests using immunofluorescent methods are more reliable than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and/or bead assays, which have less specificity. ANA-negative lupus exists but is rare in adults and is usually associated with other autoantibodies (anti-Ro or anti-DNA). High-titer IgG antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (but not to single-stranded DNA) are specific for SLE. ELISA and immunofluorescent reactions of sera with the dsDNA in the flagellate Crithidia luciliae have ~60% sensitivity for SLE; identification of high-avidity anti-dsDNA in the Farr assay is not as sensitive but may correlate better with risk for nephritis. Titers of anti-dsDNA vary over time. In some patients, increases in quantities of anti-dsDNA herald a flare, particularly of nephritis or vasculitis, especially when associated with declining levels of C3 or C4 complement. Antibodies to Sm are also specific for SLE and assist in diagnosis; anti-Sm antibodies do not usually correlate with disease activity or clinical manifestations. Antiphospholipid antibodies are not specific for SLE, but their pres-2131 ence fulfills one classification criterion, and they identify patients at increased risk for venous or arterial clotting, thrombocytopenia, and fetal loss. There are three widely accepted tests that measure different antibodies (anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein, and the lupus anticoagulant). ELISA is used for anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein (both internationally standardized with good reproducibility); a sensitive phospholipid-based activated prothrombin time such as the dilute Russell venom viper test is used to identify the lupus anticoagulant. The higher the titers of IgG anticardiolipin (>40 IU is considered high), and the greater the number of different antiphospholipid antibodies that are detected, the greater is the risk for a clinical episode of clotting. Quantities of antiphospholipid antibodies may vary markedly over time; repeated testing is justified if clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) appear (Chap. 379). To classify a patient as having APS, with or without SLE, by international criteria requires the presence of one or more clotting episodes and/or repeated fetal losses plus at least two positive tests for antiphospholipid anti bodies, at least 12 weeks apart; however, many patients with APS do not meet these stringent criteria, which are intended for inclusion of patients into studies. An additional autoantibody test with predictive value (not used for diagnosis) detects anti-Ro/SS-A, which indicates increased risk for neonatallupus,siccasyndrome,andSCLE.Womenwithchild-bearing potential and SLE should be screened for antiphospholipid antibodies and anti-Ro, because both antibodies have the potential to cause fetal harm. Screening testsforcomplete blood count,platelet count,and urinalysis may detect abnormalities that contribute to the diagnosis and influence management decisions. It is useful to follow tests that indicate the status of organ involvement known to be present during SLE flares. These might include urinalysis for hematuria and proteinuria, hemoglobin levels, platelet counts, and serum levels of creatinine or albumin. There is great interest in identification of additional markers of disease activity. Candidates include levels of anti-DNA and anti-C1q antibodies, several components of complement (C3 is most widely available), activated complement products (including those that bind to the C4d receptor on erythrocytes), IFN-inducible gene expression in peripheral blood cells, serum levels of BLyS (B lymphocyte stimulator, also called BAFF), and urinary levels of TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), or monocyte chemotactic protein1(MCP-1).Noneisuniformlyagreeduponasareliableindicator of flare or of response to therapeutic interventions. It is likely that a panelof multiple proteins willbe developed topredictbothimpending flare and response to recently instituted therapies. For now, the physician should determine for each patient whether certain laboratory test changes predict flare. If so, altering therapy in response to these changes may be advisable (30 mg of prednisone daily for 2 weeks has been shown to prevent flares in patients with rising anti-DNA plus falling complement). In addition, given the increased prevalence of atherosclerosis in SLE, it is advisable to follow the recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program for testing and treatment, including scoring of SLE as an independent risk factor, similar to diabetes mellitus. There is no cure for SLE, and complete sustained remissions are rare. Therefore, the physician should plan to induce remissions of acute flares and then maintain improvements with strategies that suppress symptoms to an acceptable level and prevent organ damage. Usually patients will endure some adverse effects of medications.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Pancytopenia with Cellular Bone Marrow\n\n\n\nPrimary bone marrow diseases Secondary to systemic diseases Myelodysplasia Systemic lupus erythematosus Paroxysmal nocturnal Hypersplenism\n\n\n\nB12, folate deficiency Myelofibrosis Overwhelming infection Some aleukemic leukemia Alcohol Myelophthisis Brucellosis Bone marrow lymphoma Sarcoidosis Hairy cell leukemia Tuberculosis\n\n\n\nQ fever Legionnaires’ disease Anorexia nervosa, starvation patient is untreated; effective therapies are often available but sufficiently complicated in their choice and delivery so as to warrant the care of a hematologist or oncologist.', 'Table 149-1 Presentation of Hematologic Disorders CONDITION SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS COMMON EXAMPLES Anemia Pallor, fatigue, heart failure, jaundice Iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia Polycythemia Irritability, cyanosis, seizures, jaundice, stroke, headache Cyanotic heart disease, infant of diabetic mother, cystic fibrosis\n\n\n\nNeutropenia Fever, pharyngitis, oral ulceration, cellulitis, Congenital or drug-induced agranulocytosis, leukemia lymphadenopathy, bacteremia, gingivitis\n\n\n\nThrombocytopenia Petechiae, ecchymosis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, ITP, leukemia epistaxis\n\n\n\nCoagulopathy Bruising, hemarthrosis, mucosal bleeding von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, DIC\n\n\n\nThrombosis Pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis Lupus anticoagulant; protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiency; factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210\n\n\n\nDIC, Disseminated intravascular coagulation; ITP, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0

In the Emergency Department, his blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 87/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical exam, his left calf is firm and severely tender on palpation. The patient cannot actively dorsiflex his left foot, and passive dorsiflexion is limited. Posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are 2+ in the right leg and 1+ in the left leg. Axial load does not increase the pain.

A:Lower limb CT scan
B:Lower limb X-ray in two projections

","['The lower extremities are most commonly affected. Clinical manifestations depend on the vessels involved, the extent and rate of obstruction, and the presence of collateral blood ﬂ ow. Presents with intermittent claudication (reproducible leg pain that occurs with walking and is always relieved with rest). As the disease progresses, pain occurs at rest and affects the distal extremities. Dorsal foot ulcerations may develop 2° to poor perfusion. A painful, cold, numb foot is characteristic of critical limb ischemia. Aortoiliac disease: Associated with Leriche’s syndrome (buttock claudication, ↓ femoral pulses, male impotence). Femoropopliteal disease: Calf claudication; pulses below the femoral artery are absent. Acute ischemia: Most often caused by embolization from the heart; acute occlusions commonly occur at bifurcations distal to the last palpable pulse. May also be 2° to cholesterol atheroembolism (“blue toe syndrome”). ■Severe chronic ischemia: Lack of blood perfusion leads to muscle atrophy, pallor, cyanosis, hair loss, and gangrene/necrosis. Carefully palpate pulses and auscultate for bruits. Measurement of ankle and brachial systolic BP (ankle-brachial index, or ABI) can provide objective evidence of atherosclerosis (rest pain usually occurs with an ABI < 0.4). A high ABI can indicate calcification of the arteries. Doppler ultrasound helps identify stenosis and occlusion. Doppler ankle systolic pressure readings that are > 90% of brachial readings are normal. Arteriography and digital subtraction angiography are necessary for surgical evaluation. Control underlying conditions (e.g., DM, other cardiac risk factors); eliminate tobacco and institute careful hygiene and foot care. Exercise helps develop collateral circulation. ASA, cilostazol, and thromboxane inhibitors may improve symptoms; anticoagulants may prevent clot formation. Angioplasty and stenting have a variable success rate that is dependent on the area of occlusion. Surgery (arterial bypass) or amputation can be employed when conservation treatment fails. Avoid β-blockers in peripheral arterial disease 2° to B2-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction. Disruption of the lymphatic circulation that results in peripheral edema and chronic infection of the extremities. Often a complication of surgery involving lymph node dissection. In underdeveloped countries, parasitic infection can lead to lymphatic obstruction, resulting in edema. Congenital malformations of the lymphatic system, such as Milroy’s disease, can present with lymphedema in childhood. Postmastectomy patients present with unexplained swelling of the upper extremity. Immigrants present with progressive swelling of the lower extremities bilaterally with no cardiac abnormalities (i.e., filariasis). Children present with progressive, bilateral swelling of the extremities. Diagnosis is clinical. Rule out other causes of edema, such as cardiac and metabolic disorders. Directed at symptom management, as no curative treatment exists. Agents such as diuretics are ineffective and relatively contraindicated. Exercise, massage therapy, and pressure garments to mobilize and limit ﬂuid accumulation may be of help. ■Maintain vigilance for cellulitis with prompt gram-antibiotic coverage for infection. Cardiac syncope is associated with one-year sudden cardiac death rates of up to 40%. A sudden, temporary loss of consciousness and postural tone 2° to cerebral hypoperfusion. Etiologies are either cardiac or noncardiac:\n\n\n\nCardiac: Valvular lesions, arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, aortic dissection. Noncardiac: Orthostatic/hypovolemic hypotension, neurologic (TIA, stroke), metabolic abnormalities, neurocardiogenic syndromes (e.g., vasovagal/micturition syncope), psychiatric. Rule out many potential etiologies. Triggers, prodromal symptoms, and associated symptoms should be investigated. Cardiac causes of syncope are typically associated with very brief or absent prodromal symptoms, a history of exertion, lack of association with changes in position, and/or a history of cardiac disease. Depending on the suspected etiology, Holter monitors or event recorders (arrhythmias), echocardiograms (structural abnormalities), and stress tests (ischemia) can be useful diagnostic tools.', 'Consider a radiograph if there is a history of trauma. Treat with rest and NSAIDs; apply ice for the first 24–48 hours. Consider splinting or immobilization. Begin strengthening exercises once pain has subsided. If conservative treatment fails, consider peritendinous injection of lidocaine and corticosteroids. Never inject the Achilles tendon in view of the ↑ risk of rupture. Avoid repetitive injection. Table 2.9-2 outlines the motor, reﬂex, and sensory deficits with which low back pain is associated. Causes include degenerative changes, trauma, or neck/back strain or sprain. Most common (95%) in the lumbar region, especially at L4–L5 and L5–S1. Presents with sudden onset of severe, electricity-like LBP, usually preceded by several months of aching, “discogenic” pain.

Order a stat MRI for cauda equina syndrome or for a severe or rapidly progressing neurologic deficit. Order an MRI if symptoms are refractory to conservative management. MRI may show disk herniation (see Figure 2.9-2). NSAIDs in scheduled doses, physical therapy, and local heat lead to resolution within four weeks in 80% of cases. Epidural or nerve block may be of benefit. Severe or rapidly evolving neurologic deficits and cauda equina syndrome are indications for discectomy. Narrowing of the lumbar or cervical spinal canal, leading to compression of the nerve roots. Most commonly due to degenerative joint disease; typically occurs in middle-aged or elderly patients. ■Presents with neck pain, back pain that radiates to the buttocks and legs, and leg numbness/weakness. Lung, breast, and prostate cancer can metastasize to the vertebrae and cause back pain.

"A group of scientists is studying the mechanism by which the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine confers immunity.

A:Endogenous antigen presentation

","['(Adapted from GA Koretzky et al: Nat Rev Immunol 6:67, 2006; with permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd. Copyright 2006.) fragments derived from protein antigens taken up or produced in APCs. Foreign antigens may be taken up by endocytosis into acidified intracellular vesicles or by phagocytosis and degraded into small peptides that associate with MHC class II molecules (exogenous antigen-presentation pathway). Other foreign antigens arise endogenously in thecytosol(suchasfromreplicatingviruses)andarebrokendowninto small peptides that associate with MHC class I molecules (endogenous antigen-presenting pathway). Thus, APCs proteolytically degrade foreign proteins and display peptide fragments embedded in the MHC class I or II antigen-recognition site on the MHC molecule surface, where foreign peptide fragments are available to bind to TCR-αβ or TCR-γδ chains of reactive T cells. CD4 molecules act as adhesives and, by direct binding to MHC class II (DR, DQ, or DP) molecules, stabilize the interaction of TCR with peptide antigen (Fig. 372e-7). Similarly, CD8 molecules also act as adhesives to stabilize the TCR-antigen interaction by direct CD8 molecule binding to MHC class I (A, B, or C) molecules. Antigens that arise in the cytosol and are processed via the endogenous antigen-presentation pathway are cleaved into small peptides by a complex of proteases called the proteasome. From the proteasome, antigen peptide fragments are transported from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by a heterodimeric complex termed transporters associated with antigen processing, or TAP proteins. There, MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane physically associate with processed cytosolic peptides. Following peptide association with class I molecules, peptide-class I complexes are exported to the Golgi apparatus, and then to the cell surface, for recognition by CD8+ T cells. Antigens taken up from the extracellular space via endocytosis into intracellular acidified vesicles are degraded by vesicle proteases into peptide fragments. Intracellular vesicles containing MHC class II molecules fuse with peptide-containing vesicles, thus allowing peptide fragmentsto physically bindto MHCclass IImolecules.Peptide-MHC class II complexes are then transported to the cell surface for recognition by CD4+ T cells (Chap. 373e). Whereas it is generally agreed that the TCR-αβ receptor recognizes peptide antigens in the context of MHC class I or class II molecules, lipids in the cell wall of intracellular bacteria such as M. tuberculosis can also be presented to a wide variety of T cells, including subsets of TCR-γδ T cells, and a subset of CD8+ TCR-αβ T cells. Importantly, bacterial lipid antigens are not presented in the context of MHC class I orIImolecules,butratherarepresentedinthecontextofMHC-related CD1 molecules. Some γδ T cells that recognize lipid antigens via CD1 molecules have very restricted TCR usage, do not need antigen priming to respond to bacterial lipids, and may actually be a form of innate rather than acquired immunity to intracellular bacteria. Just as foreign antigens are degraded and their peptide fragments presented in the context of MHC class I or class II molecules on APCs, endogenous self-proteins also are degraded, and self-peptide fragments are presented to T cells in the context of MHC class I or class II molecules on APCs. In peripheral lymphoid organs, there are T cells that are capable of recognizing self-protein fragments but normally are anergic or tolerant, i.e., nonresponsive to self-antigenic stimulation, due to lack of self-antigen upregulating APC co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) (see below). Once engagement of mature T cell TCR by foreign peptide occurs in the context of self-MHC class I or class II molecules, binding of non-antigen-specific adhesion ligand pairs such as CD54-CD11/CD18 and CD58-CD2 stabilizes MHC peptide-TCR binding, and the expression of these adhesion molecules is upregulated (Fig. 372e-7). Once antigen ligation of the TCR occurs, the T cell membrane is partitioned into lipid membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts, that coalesce the key signaling molecules TCR/CD3 complex, CD28, CD2, LAT (linker for activation of T cells), intracellular activated (dephosphorylated) src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), and the key CD3ζ-associated protein-70 (ZAP-70) PTK (Fig. 372e-7). Importantly, during T cell activation, the CD45 molecule, with protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, is partitioned away from the TCR complex to allow activating phosphorylation events to occur. The coalescence of signaling molecules of activated T lymphocytes in microdomains has suggested that T cell-APC interactions can be considered immunologic synapses, analogous in function to neuronal synapses. After TCR-MHC binding is stabilized, activation signals are transmitted through the cell to the nucleus and lead to the expression of geneproductsimportant inmediatingthewidediversityofTcellfunctions such as the secretion of IL-2. The TCR does not have intrinsic signaling activity but is linked to a variety of signaling pathways via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) expressed on the various CD3 chains that bind to proteins that mediate signal transduction. Each of the pathways results in the activation of particular transcription factors that control the expression of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes. Thus, antigen-MHC binding to the TCR induces the activation of the src family of PTKs, fyn and lck (lck is associated with CD4 or CD8 co-stimulatory molecules); phosphorylation of CD3ζ chain; activation of the related tyrosine kinases ZAP-70 and syk; and downstream activation of the calcium-dependent calcineurin pathway, the ras pathway, and the protein kinase C pathway. Each of these pathways leads to activation of specific families of transcription factors (including NF-AT, fos and jun, and rel/NF-κB) that form heteromultimers capable of inducing expression of IL-2, IL-2 receptor, IL-4, TNF-α, and other T cell mediators. In addition to the signals delivered to the T cell from the TCR complex and CD4 and CD8, molecules on the T cell, such as CD28 and inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), and molecules on DCs, such as B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86), also deliver important co-stimulatory signals that upregulate T cell cytokine production and are essential for T cell activation. If signaling through CD28 or ICOS does not occur, or if CD28 is blocked, the T cell becomes anergic rather than activated (see “Immune Tolerance and Autoimmunity” below). CTLA-4 (CD152) is similar to CD28 in its ability to bind CD80 and CD86. Unlike CD28, CTLA-4 transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells, acting as an off switch. T CELL EXHAUSTION IN VIRAL INFECTIONS AND CANCER In chronic viral infections such as HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus and in chronic malignancies, the persistence of antigen disrupts memory T cell function, resulting in defects in memory T cell responses. This has been defined as T cell exhaustion and is associated with T cell programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) (CD279) expression. Exhausted T cells have compromised proliferation and lose the ability to produce effector molecules, like IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. PD-1 downregulates T cell responses and is associated with T cell exhaustion and disease progression. For this reason, inhibition of T cell PD-1 activity to enhance effectorTcellfunction isbeing explored as atargetforimmunotherapy in both viral infections and certain malignancies. T CELL SUPERANTIGENS Conventional antigens bind to MHC class I or II molecules in the groove of the αβ heterodimer and bind to T cells via the V regions of the TCR-α and -β chains. In contrast, superantigens bind directly to the lateral portion of the TCR-β chain and MHC class II β chain and stimulate T cells based solely on the Vβ gene segment used independent of the D, J, and Vα sequences present. Superantigens are protein molecules capable of activating up to 20% of the peripheral T cell pool, whereas conventional antigens activate <1 in 10,000 T cells. T cell superantigens include staphylococcal enterotoxins and other bacterial products. Superantigen stimulation of human peripheral T cells occurs in the clinical setting of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, leading to massive overproduction of T cell cytokines that leads to hypotension and shock (Chap. 172).', 'λ5 See surrogate light chain.

"A 50-year-old man presents with a complaint of pain and swelling of his right leg for the past 2 days. He remembers hitting his leg against a table 3 days earlier. Since then, the pain and swelling of the leg have gradually increased. His past medical history is significant for atopy and pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes per day. His pulse is 98/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, temperature is 38.4°C (101.2°F), and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, his right leg is visibly swollen up to the groin with moderate erythema and 2+ pitting edema. The peripheral pulses are 2+ in the right leg and there is no discomfort. There is no increased resistance or pain in the right calf in response to forced dorsiflexion of the right foot. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?
A:Reassurance and supportive treatment
B:Outpatient management with furosemide
C:D-dimer level

","['The patient is then instructed to walk for 5 min. A patent deep venous system and competent perforating veins enable the superficial veins below the tourniquet to collapse. Deep venous obstruction is likely to be present if the superficial veins distend further with walking. Differential Diagnosis The duration of leg edema helps to distinguish chronic venous insufficiency from acute deep vein thrombosis. Lymphedema, as discussed later in this chapter, is often confused with chronic venous insufficiency, and both may occur together. Other disorders that cause leg swelling should be considered and excluded when evaluating a patient with presumed venous insufficiency. Bilateral leg swelling occurs in patients with congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome or severe hepatic disease, myxedema caused by hypothyroidism or pretibial myxedema associated with Graves’ disease, and with drugs such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and thiazolidinediones. Unilateral causes of leg swelling also include ruptured leg muscles, hematomas secondary to trauma, and popliteal cysts. Cellulitis may cause erythema and swelling of the affected limb. Leg ulcers may be caused by severe peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia; neuropathies, particularly those associated with diabetes; and less commonly, skin cancer, vasculitis, or rarely as a complication of hydroxyurea. The location and characteristics of venous ulcers help to differentiate these from other causes. Classification of Chronic Venous Disease The CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) classification schema incorporates the range of symptoms and signs of chronic venous disease to characterize its severity. It also broadly categorizes the etiology as congenital, primary, or secondary; identifies the affected veins as superficial, deep, or perforating; and characterizes the pathophysiology as reflux, obstruction, both, or neither (Table 303-1). Diagnostic Testing The principal diagnostic test to evaluate patients with chronic venous disease is venous duplex ultrasonography. A venous duplex ultrasound examination uses a combination of B-mode imaging and spectral Doppler to detect the presence of venous obstruction and venous reflux in superficial and deep veins. Color-assisted Doppler ultrasound is useful to visualize venous flow patterns. Obstruction may be diagnosed by absence of flow, the presence of an echogenic thrombus within the vein, or failure of the vein to collapse when a compression maneuver is applied by the sonographer, the last implicating the presence of an intraluminal thrombus. Venous reflux is detected by prolonged reversal of venous flow direction during a Valsalva maneuver, particularly for the common femoral vein or saphenofemoral junction, or after compression and release of a cuff placed on the limb distal to the area being interrogated. Some vascular laboratories use air or strange gauge plethysmography to assess the severity of venous reflux and complement findings from the venous ultrasound examination. Venous volume and venous refilling time are measured when the legs are placed in a dependent position and after calf exercise to quantify the severity of venous reflux and the efficiency of the calf muscle pump to affect venous return. Magnetic resonance, computed tomographic, and conventional venography are rarely required to determine the cause and plan treatment for chronic venous insufficiency unless there is suspicion for pathology that might warrant intervention. These modalities are used to identify obstruction or stenosis of the inferior vena cava and iliofemoral veins, as may occur in patients with previous proximal\n\n\n\nTABlE 303-1 CEAP (CliniCAl, ETiologiC, AnAToMiC, PATHoPHYSiologiC) ClASSiFiCATion\n\n\n\nC0 No visible or palpable signs of venous disease C1 Telangiectasias, reticular veins C2 Varicose veins C3 Edema without skin changes C4 Skin changes, including pigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, and\n\n\n\nPr Reflux Po Obstruction Pr,o Reflux and obstruction Pn No venous pathophysiology identifiable\n\n\n\nSource: B Eklöf et al: J Vasc Surg 40:1248, 2004. deep vein thrombosis; occlusion of inferior vena cava filters; extrinsic compression from tumors; and May-Thurner syndrome. Varicose veins usually are treated with conservative measures. Symptoms often decrease when the legs are elevated periodically, prolonged standing is avoided, and elastic support hose are worn. External compression with elastic stockings or stretch bandages provides a counterbalance to the hydrostatic pressure in the veins. Although compression garments may improve symptoms, they do not prevent progression of varicose veins. Graduated compression stockings with pressures of 20–30 mmHg are suitable for most patients with simple varicose veins, although pressures of 30–40 mmHg may be required for patients with manifestations of venous insufficiency such as edema and ulcers. Patients with chronic venous insufficiency also should be advised to avoid prolonged standing or sitting; frequent leg elevation is helpful. Graded compression therapy consisting of stockings or multilayered compression bandages is the standard of care for advanced chronic venous insufficiency characterized by edema, skin changes, or venous ulcers defined as CEAP clinical class C3– C6. Graduated compression stockings of 30–40 mmHg are more effective than lesser grades for healing venous ulcers. The length of stocking depends on the distribution of edema. Calf-length stockings are tolerated better by most patients, particularly elderly patients; for patients with varicose veins or edema extending to the thigh, thigh-length stockings or panty hose should be considered. Overweight and obese patients should be advised to lose weight via caloric restriction and exercise.', 'Treatment is optimal with urgent surgical repair.

","['OACs are typically avoided. Cocaine and methamphetamine are frequent causes of stroke in young (age <45 years) patients. ICH, ischemic stroke, and SAH are all associated with stimulant use. Angiographic findings vary from completely normal arteries to large-vessel occlusion or stenosis, vasospasm, or changes consistent with vasculopathy. The mechanism of sympathomimetic-related stroke is not known, but cocaine enhances sympathetic activity causing acute, sometimes severe, hypertension, and this may lead to hemorrhage. Slightly more than one-half of stimulant-related intracranial hemorrhages are intracerebral, and the rest are subarachnoid. In cases of SAH, a saccular aneurysm is usually identified. Presumably, acute hypertension causes aneurysmal rupture. Head injury often causes intracranial bleeding. The common sites are intraparenchymal (especially temporal and inferior frontal lobes) and into the subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural spaces. Trauma must be considered in any patient with an unexplained acute neurologic deficit (hemiparesis, stupor, or confusion), particularly if the deficit occurred in the context of a fall (Chap. 457e). Intracranial hemorrhages associated with anticoagulant therapy can occur at any location; they are often lobar or subdural. Anticoagulant-related ICHs may continue to evolve over 24–48 h, especially if coagulopathy is insufficiently reversed. Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia should be reversed rapidly, as discussed below. ICH associated with hematologic disorders (leukemia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura) can occur at any site and may present as multiple ICHs. Skin and mucous membrane bleeding may be evident and offers a diagnostic clue. Hemorrhage into a brain tumor may be the first manifestation of neoplasm. Choriocarcinoma, malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and bronchogenic carcinoma are among the most common metastatic tumors associated with ICH. Glioblastoma multiforme in adults and medulloblastoma in children may also have areas of ICH. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a complication of malignant hypertension. In this acute syndrome, severe hypertension is associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, confusion, stupor, and coma. Focal or lateralizing neurologic signs, either transitory or permanent, may occur but are infrequent and therefore suggest some other vascular disease (hemorrhage, embolism, or atherosclerotic thrombosis). There are retinal hemorrhages, exudates, papilledema (hypertensive retinopathy), and evidence of renal and cardiac disease. In most cases, ICP and CSF protein levels are elevated. MRI brain imaging shows a pattern of typically posterior (occipital > frontal) brain edema that is reversible and termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. The hypertension may be essential or due to chronic renal disease, acute glomerulonephritis, acute toxemia of pregnancy, pheochromocytoma, or other causes. Lowering the blood pressure reverses the process, but stroke can occur, especially if blood pressure is lowered too rapidly. Neuropathologic examination reveals multifocal to diffuse cerebral edema and hemorrhages of various sizes from petechial to massive. Microscopically, there are necrosis of arterioles, minute cerebral infarcts, and hemorrhages. The term hypertensive encephalopathy should be reserved for this syndrome and not for chronic recurrent headaches, dizziness, recurrent TIAs, or small strokes that often occur in association with high blood pressure. Primary intraventricular hemorrhage is rare and should prompt investigation for an underlying vascular anomaly. Sometimes bleeding begins within the periventricular substance of the brain and dissects into the ventricular system without leaving signs of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Alternatively, bleeding can arise from periependymal veins. Vasculitis, usually polyarteritis nodosa or lupus erythematosus, can produce hemorrhage in any region of the central nervous system; most hemorrhages are associated with hypertension, but the arteritis itself may cause bleeding by disrupting the vessel wall. Nearly one-half of patients with primary intraventricular hemorrhage have identifiable bleeding sources seen using conventional angiography. Sepsis can cause small petechial hemorrhages throughout the cerebral white matter. Moyamoya disease, mainly an occlusive arterial disease that causes ischemic symptoms, may on occasion produce ICH, particularly in the young. Hemorrhages into the spinal cord are usually the result of an AVM, cavernous malformation, or metastatic tumor. Epidural spinal hemorrhage produces a rapidly evolving syndrome of spinal cord or nerve root compression (Chap. 456). Spinal hemorrhages usually present with sudden back pain and some manifestation of myelopathy. Laboratory and Imaging Evaluation Patients should have routine blood chemistries and hematologic studies.', 'The patient initially underwent CT and MRI scanning. Currently, the definitive test for assessment of aneurysms arising from the circle of Willis and its branches is a digital subtraction angiogram. The angiogram demonstrated the posterior communicating artery aneurysm. The patient underwent surgery and made an excellent recovery. A 10-year-old boy was brought to an ENT surgeon (ear, nose, and throat surgeon) with epistaxis (nose bleeding). The bleeding was associated with his nose picking habit. However, the bleeding was profuse and on two occasions required hospital admission and nasal packing. On inspection an indurated area was noted. The typical findings are an indurated area in the anterior inferior aspect of the nasal septum (Kiesselbach’s area). This is a very vascular area that has a considerable number of veins, which are often traumatized during nose picking. The patient underwent treatment. Typical treatment is cauterization of these prominent veins in Kiesselbach’s area, which is usually performed by a simple local analgesia and the application of silver nitrate. Unfortunately, the boy was involved in a fight the next day and again developed severe epistaxis, which again was difficult to control. Not only is there a rich venous plexus around Kiesselbach’s area, but there is also a significant arterial supply, which is provided from the nasal septal branches of the posterior and anterior ethmoidal arteries and the branches of the greater palatine artery. These are supplemented from the septal branches of the superior labial artery.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['normal arteries to large-vessel occlusion or stenosis, vasospasm, or changes consistent with vasculopathy.

","['coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, and V. cholerae contribute to diarrheal disease caused by these organisms. 145e-9 Staphylococci, streptococci, P. aeruginosa, and Bordetella elaborate various toxins that cause or contribute to disease, including toxic shock syndrome toxin 1; erythrogenic toxin; exotoxins A, S, T, and U; and pertussis toxin. A number of bacterial toxins (e.g., cholera toxin, diphtheria toxin, pertussis toxin, E. coli heat-labile toxin, and P. aeruginosa exotoxin) have adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase activity; i.e., the toxins enzymatically catalyze the transfer of the adenosine diphosphate ribosyl portion of nicotinamide adenine diphosphate to target proteins and inactivate them. The staphylococcal enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and the streptococcal pyogenic exotoxins behave as superantigens, stimulating certain T cells to proliferate without processing of the protein toxin by antigen-presenting cells. Part of this process involves stimulation of the antigen-presenting cells to produce IL-1 and TNF-α, which have been implicated in many clinical features of diseases like toxic shock syndrome and scarlet fever. A number of gram-negative pathogens (Salmonella, Yersinia, and P. aeruginosa) can inject toxins directly into host target cells by means of a complex set of proteins referred to as the type III secretion system. Loss or inactivation of this virulence system usually greatly reduces the capacity of a bacterial pathogen to cause disease. Endotoxin The lipid A portion of gram-negative LPS has potent biologic activities that cause many of the clinical manifestations of gram-negative bacterial sepsis, including fever, muscle proteolysis, uncontrolled intravascular coagulation, and shock. The effects of lipid A appear to be mediated by the production of potent cytokines due to LPS binding to CD14 and signal transduction via TLRs, particularly TLR4. Cytokines exhibit potent hypothermic activity through effects on the hypothalamus; they also increase vascular permeability, alter the activity of endothelial cells, and induce endothelial-cell procoagulant activity. Numerous therapeutic strategies aimed at neutralizing the effects of endotoxin are under investigation, but so far the results have been disappointing. It has been suggested that this lack of success may be due to substantial differences between mouse and human inflammatory responses to factors such as endotoxin; thus drugs developed in mouse models of infection may not be applicable to the human response. Invasion Many diseases are caused primarily by pathogens growing in tissue sites that are normally sterile. Pneumococcal pneumonia is mostly attributable to the growth of S. pneumoniae in the lung and the attendant host inflammatory response, although specific factors that enhance this process (e.g., pneumolysin) may be responsible for some of the pathogenic potential of the pneumococcus.

It occurs following the inhalation of spores that become deposited in the alveolar spaces. These spores are phagocytized by macrophages and transported to the mediastinal and peribronchial lymph nodes where they germinate, leading to active bacterial growth and elaboration of the bacterial products edema toxin and lethal toxin. Subsequent hematogenous spread of bacteria is accompanied by cardiovascular collapse and death. The earliest symptoms are typically a viral-like prodrome with fever, malaise, and abdominal and/or chest symptoms that progress over the course of a few days to a moribund state.

Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic gram-positive organism that elaborates two toxins, A and B, responsible for disruption of the intestinal mucosa when organism numbers expand in the intestine, leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and potentially to pseudomembranous colitis.

","['Unsteady gait. Nystagmus. Impairment in attention or memory. Stupor or coma. 9791:5939)?', 'Comatose patients with an intact VOR will demonstrate the slow phase gaze deviation without the fast phase nystagmus to which this mnemonic refers. Chapter 14 discusses the production of nystagmus by labyrinthine stimulation and other features of vestibular nystagmus. Brainstem lesions often cause a coarse, unidirectional, gaze-evoked nystagmus, which may be horizontal or vertical, meaning that the nystagmus is exaggerated when the eyes sustain an eccentric position of gaze. Vertical nystagmus, for example, is brought out usually on upward gaze, less often downward. Unlike the vestibular nystagmus discussed above, the central type usually also changes direction depending on the direction of gaze. Vertigo is less common or less intense than with labyrinthine nystagmus, but signs of disease of other nuclear structures and tracts in the brainstem are frequent. Downbeat nystagmus, which is always of central origin, is characteristic of lesions in the medullary–cervical region such as syringobulbia, Chiari malformation, basilar invagination, and demyelinating plaques. It has also been seen with Wernicke disease and may be an initial sign of either paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitis or cerebellar degeneration with opsoclonus. Downbeat nystagmus has also been observed in patients with lithium intoxication or with profound magnesium depletion (Saul and Selhorst). Halmagyi and coworkers, who studied 62 patients with downbeat nystagmus, found that half were associated with Chiari malformation and various forms of cerebellar degeneration; in most of the remainder, the cause could not be determined. Cases associated with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a substance that has a documented relationship to the stiff man syndrome, have been reported by Antonini and colleagues and by other groups. Whether this antibody explains the idiopathic cases of downbeat nystagmus is not known. Spontaneous upbeat nystagmus can be observed in patients with demyelinating or vascular disease, tumors, or Wernicke disease. There is still uncertainty about the anatomic basis of coarse upbeat nystagmus, but it has been associated with lesions of the midbrain and cerebellum (particularly the anterior cerebellar vermis). Kato and associates also cite cases with a lesion at the pontomedullary junction involving the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, which receives vestibular connections and projects to all brainstem and cerebellar regions concerned with ocular motor functions. Nystagmus of several types—including gaze-evoked nystagmus, downbeat nystagmus, and “rebound nystagmus” (gaze-evoked nystagmus that changes direction with refixation to the primary position)—occurs with cerebellar disease, particularly with lesions of the vestibulocerebellum or with brainstem lesions that involve the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and the medial vestibular nucleus. Also characteristic of cerebellar disease are several closely related disorders of saccadic movement that appear as nystagmus (opsoclonus, flutter, dysmetria) described in the following text. Tumors situated in the cerebellopontine angle may cause a coarse bilateral horizontal nystagmus that is higher amplitude to the side of the lesion (Brun’s nystagmus). Nystagmus that occurs only in the abducting eye is referred to as dissociated nystagmus and is a common sign of internuclear ophthalmoplegia, as discussed earlier. Infantile (Congenital, Pendular) Nystagmus\n\n\n\nThis nystagmus can occur in association with profound visual loss or as an isolated abnormality with relatively preserved visual function. When accompanied by visual loss, it may be associated with albinism, Leber’s congenital amaurosis, and various other diseases of the retina and refractive media. Occasionally it is observed as a congenital abnormality, even without poor vision. The defect in infantile nystagmus is postulated to be instability of smooth pursuit or gaze-holding mechanisms. A cardinal feature of this type of nystagmus is that it is in one plane; that is, it remains horizontal even during vertical movement. It is mainly pendular (sinusoidal) except in extremes of gaze, when it comes to resemble jerk nystagmus. Eye movement recordings demonstrate an exponentially increasing velocity of the slow phase that is unique among nystagmus. Infantile nystagmus is often suppressed during convergence. Many individuals have a “null position,” where the nystagmus is dampened in a particular direction of gaze. These patients, therefore, adopt a compensatory head turn in order to utilize the null position, where the retinal image is most stable, to its maximum effect. Also characteristic is a paradoxical response to optokinetic testing (see later), in which the quick phase is in the same direction as the drum rotation. The related condition of latent nystagmus refers to nystagmus that occurs when one eye is covered. The fast phase of the nystagmus is in the direction of the covered eye. The finding may occur when either is covered, or it may be asymmetric and occur only with covering one of the eyes but not the other. Latent nystagmus is considered to be a result of impaired development of binocular stereoscopic vision. In some individuals with this condition who then lose vision in one eye later in life, the latent nystagmus becomes unmasked constantly and is termed manifest latent nystagmus. Even in adulthood, severe acquired blindness can produce nystagmus of pendular or jerk variety. Both horizontal and vertical components are evident and the characteristic feature is a fluctuation over several seconds of observation in the dominant direction of beating. The oscillations of the eyes are usually very rapid, increase on upward gaze, and may be associated with compensatory oscillations of the head. The formerly common syndrome of “miner’s nystagmus” is an associated condition that occurs in patients who have worked for many years in comparative darkness. Spasmus nutans, a specific type of pendular nystagmus of infancy, is accompanied by head nodding, and occasionally by wry positions of the neck. Most cases begin between the 4th and 12th months of life, never after the 3rd year. The nystagmus may be horizontal, vertical, or rotatory; it is usually more pronounced in one eye than the other (or limited to one eye) and can be intensified by immobilizing or straightening the head. Most infants recover within a few months or years. Most cases are idiopathic, but symptoms like those of spasmus nutans may betray the presence of a perichiasmal or third ventricular tumor (see also seesaw nystagmus below in “Other Types of Nystagmus”); rare cases accompany childhood retinal diseases. Although there is no direct connection to the rare childhood condition of bobble-head syndrome, which is caused by lesions in or adjacent to the third ventricle, they are similar in the rhythmic head movements as described in Chap. 29. Acquired forms of pendular nystagmus may occur with leukodystrophies, including Pelizaeus-Merzbacher syndrome (see Chap. 36), multiple sclerosis (see Chap. 35), and toluene intoxication. In the oculomasticatory myorhythmia of Whipple disease, the nystagmus is conjoined to rhythmic jaw movements (see Chap. 31). Other Types of Nystagmus\n\n\n\nConvergence nystagmus refers to a rhythmic oscillation in which a slow abduction of both eyes is followed by a quick movement of adduction, usually accompanied by quick rhythmic retraction movements of the eyes (retraction nystagmus) and by one or more features of the Parinaud–dorsal midbrain syndrome discussed earlier in the chapter. There may also be rhythmic movements of the eyelids or a maintained spasm of convergence, best brought out on attempted elevation of the eyes on command or downward rotation of an OKN drum (see below for discussion of optokinetic nystagmus). These unusual phenomena all point to a lesion of the upper midbrain tegmentum and are usually manifestations of vascular disease, traumatic damage, or tumor, notably pinealoma that compresses this region. Seesaw nystagmus is a torsional-vertical oscillation in which the intorting eye moves up and the opposite (extorting) eye moves down, then both move in the reverse direction. It is occasionally observed in conjunction with chiasmatic bitemporal hemianopia caused by sellar or parasellar masses and after pituitary surgery. Periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN) is a remarkable horizontal jerking that periodically (every 90 s, or so) changes direction, interposed with a brief neutral period during which the eyes show no nystagmus, or jerk downward. PAN is seen with lesions in the lower brainstem but has also been reported with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, hepatic encephalopathy, lesions of the cerebellar nodulus, carcinomatous meningitis, anti-GAD antibodies, and varied other processes. A congenital form is associated with albinism. It differs from ping-pong gaze, which is a saccadic variant with a more rapid alternating of gaze from side to side and usually the result of severe bilateral hemispheric disease. So-called oculopalatal tremor is caused by a lesion of the central tegmental tract and may be accompanied by a pendular nystagmus that has the same beat as the palatal and pharyngeal muscles, as discussed in Chap. 4. Roving conjugate eye movements are characteristic of light coma. Horizontal ocular deviations that shift every few seconds from side to side (ping-pong gaze) is a form of roving eye movement that occurs with bihemispheric infarctions or sometimes with posterior fossa lesions. Fisher has noted a similar slower, side-to-side pendular oscillation of the eyes (“windshield-wiper eyes”). This phenomenon has been associated with bilateral hemispheric lesions that have presumably released a brainstem oscillatory pacemaker. Ocular bobbing is a term coined by Fisher to describe a distinctive spontaneous fast downward jerk of the eyes followed by a slow upward drift to the midposition. It is observed in comatose patients in whom horizontal eye movements have been obliterated by large destructive lesions of the pons, less often of the cerebellum. The movements may be disconjugate in the vertical plane, especially if there is an associated third-nerve palsy on one side. Other spontaneous vertical eye movements have been given a variety of confusing names: atypical bobbing, inverse bobbing, reverse bobbing, and ocular dipping. For the most part, they are observed in coma of metabolic or anoxic origin in which reflexive horizontal eye movements may be preserved (in distinction to ocular bobbing). Ocular dipping describes an arrhythmic slow conjugate downward movement followed in several seconds by a more rapid upward movement; it occurs spontaneously but may at times be elicited by moving the limbs or neck. Anoxic encephalopathy has been the most common cause, but a few cases have followed drug overdose (Ropper, 1981). Oculogyric crisis, formerly associated with postencephalitic parkinsonism, is now most often caused by phenothiazine drugs, as discussed earlier. Saccadic Intrusions (Opsoclonus, Ocular Flutter, and Square Wave Jerks)\n\n\n\nThis group of phasic or repetitive eye movements is distinguished from nystagmus in that each is composed of abnormal saccades without intervening slow phase eye movements. Opsoclonus is the term applied to rapid, conjugate oscillations of the eyes in horizontal, rotatory, and vertical directions, often made worse by voluntary movement or the need to fixate the eyes. These movements are continuous and chaotic, without an intersaccadic pause (hence the colorful term saccadomania). They can be observed even when the eyes are closed, and often persist in sleep.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Brainstem lesions often cause a coarse, unidirectional, gaze-evoked nystagmus, which may be horizontal or vertical, meaning that the nystagmus is exaggerated when the eyes sustain an eccentric position of gaze.

Thrush occurs predominantly in neonates, immunocompromised patients (especially those with AIDS), and recipients of prolonged antibiotic or glucocorticoid therapy. In addition to sore throat, patients often report a burning tongue, and physical examination reveals friable white or gray plaques on the gingiva, tongue, and oral mucosa. Treatment, which usually consists of an oral antifungal suspension (nystatin or clotrimazole) or oral fluconazole, is typically successful. In the uncommon cases of fluconazole-refractory thrush that are seen in some patients with HIV/AIDS, other therapeutic options include oral formulations of itraconazole or voriconazole as well as an IV echinocandin (caspofungin, micafungin, or anidulafungin) or amphotericin B deoxycholate, if needed. In these cases, therapy based on culture and susceptibility test results is ideal. Vincent’s angina, also known as acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or trench mouth, is a unique and dramatic form of gingivitis characterized by painful, inflamed gingiva with ulcerations of the interdental papillae that bleed easily. Since oral anaerobes are the cause, patients typically have halitosis and frequently present with fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Treatment consists of debridement and oral administration of penicillin plus metronidazole, with clindamycin or doxycycline alone as an alternative. Ludwig’s angina is a rapidly progressive, potentially fulminant form of cellulitis that involves the bilateral sublingual and sub-mandibular spaces and that typically originates from an infected or recently extracted tooth, most commonly the lower second and third molars. Improved dental care has reduced the incidence of this disorder substantially. Infection in these areas leads to dysphagia, odynophagia, and “woody” edema in the sublingual region, forcing the tongue up and back with the potential for airway obstruction. Fever, dysarthria, and drooling also may be noted, and patients may speak in a “hot potato” voice. Intubation or tracheostomy may be necessary to secure the airway, as asphyxiation is the most common cause of death. Patients should be monitored closely and treated promptly with IV antibiotics directed against streptococci and oral anaerobes. Recommended agents include ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, or high-dose penicillin plus metronidazole. Postanginal septicemia (Lemierre’s disease) is a rare anaerobic oropharyngeal infection caused predominantly by F. necrophorum. The illness typically starts as a sore throat (most commonly in adolescents and young adults), which may present as exudative tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess. Infection of the deep pharyngeal tissue allows\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 44 Sore Throat, Earache, and Upper Respiratory Symptoms 234 organisms to drain into the lateral pharyngeal space, which contains the carotid artery and internal jugular vein.

These receptors can be characterized according to: 1. Relative potency of endogenous and pharmacological agonists and antagonists. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are potent agonists for α receptors and for β1 and β3 receptors, whereas epinephrine is more potent than norepinephrine for β2 receptors. A large number of synthetic selective and nonselective adrenergic agonists and antagonists now exist. 2. Downstream signaling pathways. Table 43.1 shows the primary pathways that are coupled to the different adrenergic receptors. This is an oversimplification, because differences in signaling pathways for a given receptor have been linked to the duration of agonist exposure and cell type. 3. Location and relative density of receptors. Importantly, different receptor types predominate in different tissues. For example, although both α and β receptors are expressed by pancreatic islet beta cells, the predominant response to a sympathetic discharge is mediated by α2 receptors. Physiological Actions  of Adrenomedullary Catecholamines\n\n\n\nBecause the adrenal medulla is directly innervated by the autonomic nervous system, adrenomedullary responses are very rapid. Furthermore, because of the involvement of several centers in the central nervous system (CNS), most notably the cerebral cortex, adrenomedullary responses can precede onset of the actual stress (i.e., they can be anticipated) (see\n\n\n\nFig. 43.5 ). In many cases the adrenomedullary output, which is primarily epinephrine, is coordinated with sympathetic nervous activity as determined by the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic neurons. However, some stimuli (e.g., hypoglycemia) evoke a stronger adrenomedullary than sympathetic nervous response and vice versa. Many organs and tissues are affected by a sympathoadrenal response (\n\n\n\nTable 43.2). An informative example of the major physiological roles of catecholamines is the sympathoadrenal response to exercise. Exercise is similar to the “fight-or-flight” response but without the subjective element of fear, and it involves a greater adrenomedullary response (i.e., endocrine role of epinephrine) than a sympathetic nervous response (i.e., neurotransmitter role of norepinephrine). The overall goal of the sympathoadrenal system during exercise is to meet the increased energy demands of skeletal and cardiac muscle while maintaining sufficient oxygen and glucose supply to the brain. The response to exercise includes the following major physiological actions of epinephrine (\n\n\n\nFig. 43.6): 1. Increased blood flow to muscles is achieved by the integrated action of norepinephrine and epinephrine on the heart, veins and lymphatics, and nonmuscular (e.g., splanchnic) and muscular arteriolar beds. •Fig.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['Many agonist drugs, when administered at concentrations sufficient to saturate the receptor pool, can activate their receptor-effector systems to the maximum extent of which the system is capable; that is, they cause a shift of almost all of the receptor pool to the Ra–D pool. Such drugs are termed full agonists. Other drugs, called partial agonists, bind to the same receptors and activate them in the same way but do not evoke as great a response, no matter how high the concentration. In the model in Figure 1–3, partial agonists do not stabilize the Ra configuration as fully as full agonists, so that a significant fraction of receptors exists in the Ri–D pool. Such drugs are said to have low intrinsic efficacy. Because they occupy the receptor, partial agonists can also prevent access by full agonists. Thus, pindolol, a β-adrenoceptor partial agonist, may act either as an agonist (if no full agonist is present) or as an antagonist (if a full agonist such as epinephrine is present).', 'The β3 adrenoreceptor is a lower affinity receptor compared with β1 and β2 receptors but is more resistant to desensitization. It is found in several tissues, but its physiologic or pathologic role in humans is not clear. β3 receptors are expressed in the detrusor muscle of the bladder and induce its relaxation. Mirabegron, a selective β3 agonist, is approved for the treatment of symptoms of overactive bladder (urinary urgency and frequency). A small increase in blood pressure was observed in clinical trials; the longterm significance of this finding is not clear.\n\n\n\nC. Dopamine Receptors\n\n\n\nThe D1 receptor is typically associated with the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (Table 9–1); for example, D1-receptor–induced smooth muscle relaxation is presumably due to cAMP accumulation in the smooth muscle of those vascular beds in which dopamine is a vasodilator. D2 receptors have been found to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, open potassium channels, and decrease calcium influx.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0

The Schilling test (ingestion of radiolabeled cobalamin both with and without added intrinsic factor) is classic for measuring absorption of cobalamin but is rarely performed. Serum vitamin levels are poorly diagnostic of deficiencies and are thus used with adjunctive tests, including methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine levels:\n\n\n\nB12 def ciency: Elevated MMA and homocysteine. Folate def ciency: Normal MMA; elevated homocysteine. Address the cause of the anemia, and correct the underlying cause.

Etiologies include the following:\n\n\n\nG6PD def ciency: An X-linked recessive disease that ↑ RBC sensitivity to oxidative stress. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: A disorder in which blood cell sensitivity to complement activation is ↑. Hereditary spherocytosis: An abnormality of the RBC membrane. Autoimmune RBC destruction: Occurs 2º to EBV infection, mycoplasmal infection, CLL, rheumatoid disease, or medications. Sickle cell disease: A recessive β-globin mutation (see the following section). Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia: TTP, HUS, DIC. Mechanical hemolysis: Associated with mechanical heart valves. Other: Malaria, hypersplenism. Presents with pallor, fatigue, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Patients are typically jaundiced, with low haptoglobin and elevated indirect bilirubin and LDH. Urine is dark with hemoglobinuria, and there is ↑ excretion of urinary and fecal urobilinogen. Reticulocyte count is elevated. Diagnosed by the history and clinical presentation. High LDH, elevated indirect bilirubin, and ↓ haptoglobin levels are consistent with a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. Also obtain a reticulocyte count. A Coombs’ test is used to detect autoimmune hemolysis. Treatment varies with the cause of hemolysis but typically includes corticosteroids to address immunologic causes and iron supplementation to replace urinary losses. Splenectomy may be helpful, and transfusion may be necessary to treat severe anemia. A rare condition caused by failure of blood cell production due to destruction of bone marrow cells. It may be hereditary, as in Fanconi’s anemia; may have an autoimmune or a viral etiology (e.g., HIV, parvovirus B19); or may result from exposure to toxins (e.g., drugs, cleaning solvents) or radiation. Patients are typically pancytopenic, with symptoms resulting from a lack of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets—e.g., pallor, weakness, a tendency to infection, petechiae, bruising, and bleeding. The disease may be of sudden or sustained onset and may be of variable severity, depending on the patient’s blood counts. Diagnosed by clinical presentation and CBC; verifed by a bone marrow biopsy revealing hypocellularity and space occupied by fat. The differential includes megaloblastic anemia, as both diseases feature an elevated MCV. The classic case of G6PD deficiency is an African-American male soldier in Vietnam who took quinine. Indirect Coombs’ tests detect antibodies to RBCs in the patient’s serum. Direct Coombs’ tests detect sensitized erythrocytes. Patients with Fanconi’s anemia may be identified on physical exam by café au lait spots, short stature, and radial/thumb hypoplasia/ aplasia. SCD represents a qualitative defect in the β-globin chain. Patients with SCD classically get osteomyelitis with Salmonella. They are also at ↑ risk of avascular necrosis of the hip. Blood transfusion and stem cell transplantation to replace absent cells; immunosuppression with cyclosporin A and antithymocyte globulin to prevent autoimmune destruction of marrow. Infections are a major cause of mortality and should be treated aggressively. An autosomal-recessive disorder most commonly caused by a mutation of adult hemoglobin (the β chain has glu replaced by val). Signs and symptoms are due to ↓ red cell survival and a tendency of sickled cells to lead to vasoocclusion. Asymptomatic during the first year or two of life; may first present with dactylitis in childhood. Later, hemolysis results in anemia, jaundice, cholelithiasis, ↑ cardiac output (murmur and cardiomegaly), and delayed growth. Vaso-occlusion leads to ischemic organ damage, especially splenic infarction, which predisposes to pneumococcal sepsis, and acute chest syndrome (pneumonia and/or pulmonary infarction). Patients also experience painful crises of unknown etiology. Common triggers for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) include cold temperatures, dehydration, and infection. Other potential complications include splenic sequestration, which occurs in patients who have not infarcted their spleens, and aplastic crisis, which is usually 2° to infection with parvovirus B19. The sickle cell screen is based on a blood smear with sickle cells and target cells. The gold standard is quantitative hemoglobin electrophoresis. Treat with hydroxyurea, which stimulates the production of fetal hemoglobin (hydroxyurea is teratogenic, so it is contraindicated in pregnancy). If hydroxyurea does not prove effective, chronic transfusion therapy, which carries the risk of iron overload, can be tried. Treat cholelithiasis with cholecystectomy. VOCs must be treated with adequate pain management, O2 therapy, IV ﬂuid rehydration, and antibiotics (if infection is suspected to be the trigger). To prevent VOCs from progressing to acute chest syndrome, initiate aggressive hydration and incentive spirometry, and keep the sickle variant < 40%. This can be done with simple transfusions or, if necessary, exchange transfusion in an ICU setting. Hereditary disorders involving ↓ or absent production of normal globin chains of hemoglobin. α-thalassemia is caused by a mutation of one or more of the four genes for α-hemoglobin; β-thalassemia results from a mutation of one or both of the two genes for β-hemoglobin. Thalassemia is most common among people of African, Middle Eastern, and Asian descent. Disease presentation and prognosis vary with the number of genes missing (see Table 2.7-5). Diagnosed by hemoglobin electrophoresis evaluation (but note that this is normal in α-thalassemia) and DNA studies. Most patients do not require treatment, but those with β-thalassemia major and hemoglobin H disease are commonly transfusion dependent and should be given iron chelators (deferoxamine) to prevent overload. Erythrocytosis (an abnormal elevation of hematocrit) may be either 1° (due to ↑ RBC production) or 2° (due to ↓ plasma volume and hemoconcentration). T AB LE 2.7 -5. Differential Diagnosis of Thalassemias β-thalassemia major 0/2 β Patients develop severe microcytic anemia in the frst year of life and need chronic transfusions or marrow transplant to survive. β-thalassemia minor 1/2 β Patients are asymptomatic, but their cells are microcytic and hypochromic on peripheral smear. Hydrops fetalis 0/4 α Patients die in utero. Hemoglobin H disease 1/4 α Patients have severe hypochromic, microcytic anemia with chronic hemolysis, splenomegaly, jaundice, and cholelithiasis. The reticulocyte count elevates to compensate, and one-third of patients have skeletal changes due to expanded erythropoiesis. α-thalassemia trait 2/4 α Patients have low MCV but are usually asymptomatic. Silent carrier 3/4 α Patients have no signs or symptoms of disease. True polycythemia vera is characterized by a high red cell mass. Premedication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine is sometimes used to prevent transfusion reactions. Hemoglobinuria in hemolytic transfusion reaction may lead to acute tubular necrosis and subsequent renal failure. Characterized by ↑ hematocrit, ↓ tissue blood ﬂow and oxygenation, and ↑ cardiac work. Patients present with “hyperviscosity syndrome,” which consists of easy bleeding/bruising, blurred vision, neurologic abnormalities, plethora, pruritus (especially after a warm bath), hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and CHF. 1° erythrocytosis is associated with hypoxia (from lung disease, smoking, high altitudes, or a poor intrauterine environment), neoplasia (erythropoietin-producing tumors), or polycythemia vera (PCV), in which there is clonal proliferation of a pluripotent marrow stem cell. 2° erythrocytosis is associated with excessive diuresis, severe gastroenteritis, and burns. Erythrocytosis is diagnosed clinically and by cell counts, with ABGs used to assess hypoxia or imaging to demonstrate neoplasia. Patients with PCV have excess RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. Levels of erythropoietin may be useful in distinguishing PCV, in which levels are low, from other causes of polycythemia. Phlebotomy relieves symptoms of erythrocytosis, but treatment should also address the underlying cause. PCV can be treated with cytoreductive drugs such as hydroxyurea or interferon. Because PCV is prothrombotic, ASA should also be used. With treatment, survival is 7–10 years. Blood transfusion is generally safe but may result in a variety of adverse reactions. Nonhemolytic febrile reactions and minor allergic reactions are the most common, each occurring in 3–4% of all transfusions. Etiologies are as follows:\n\n\n\nNonhemolytic febrile reactions: Involve cytokine formation during the storage of blood, and WBC antibodies. Minor allergic reactions: Involve antibody formation (usually IgA) against donor proteins. Usually occur following transfusion of plasma-containing product. Hemolytic transfusion reactions: Entail the development of antibodies against donor erythrocytes. Usually result from ABO incompatibility or from antibody against minor antigens. Nonhemolytic febrile reactions: Present with fever, chills, rigors, and malaise. Symptom onset is 1–6 hours following transfusion. Minor allergic reactions: Characterized by urticaria. Hemolytic transfusion reactions: Present with fever, chills, nausea, ﬂ ushing, apprehension, back pain, burning at the IV site, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Symptoms begin following the transfusion of only a small amount of blood. Diagnosed by clinical impression. Nonhemolytic febrile reactions: Stop the transfusion and control fever with acetaminophen. Rule out infection. Minor allergic reactions: Administer antihistamines. In the setting of a severe reaction, stop the transfusion and give epinephrine +/– steroids. Hemolytic transfusion reactions: Stop the transfusion immediately. Replace donor blood with normal saline; administer vigorous IV ﬂ uids; and maintain good urine output (diuretics and pressors may be used to ↑ renal blood ﬂ ow). The porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders that include acute intermittent porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, and erythropoietic porphyria. Some porphyrias are autosomal dominant (e.g., acute intermittent porphyria) and others autosomal recessive (e.g., erythropoietic porphyria). All involve abnormalities of heme production that lead to an accumulation of porphyrins. Signs and symptoms vary with the type of porphyria. In general, however, porphyrias are characterized by a combination of photodermatitis, neuropsychiatric complaints, and visceral complaints that typically take the form of a colicky abdominal pain and seizures. Physical exam reveals tachycardia, skin erythema and blisters, aref exia, and a nonspecifc abdominal exam. Patients with the erythropoietic form present with hemolytic anemia. Acute attacks are associated with stimulants of ↑ heme synthesis such as fasting or chemical exposures; well-known triggers are alcohol, barbiturates, and OCPs. Urine may appear red or brown after an acute attack. Patients may have a  family history.', 'Anemia, usually mild initially, is the rule, whereas the leukocyte and platelet counts are either normal or increased, but either can be depressed.

Labs: Abnormalities include ↑ serum alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium and phosphate levels; urinary pyridinolines may be helpful. Must be differentiated from metastatic bone disease. The majority of patients are asymptomatic and require no treatment. There is no cure for Paget’s disease. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin are used to slow osteoclastic bone resorption; NSAIDs and acetaminophen can be given for arthritis pain. Pathologic fractures, cardiac complications, osteosarcoma (up to 1%). Eighty percent of 1° cases are due to a single adenoma and 15% to parathyroid hyperplasia. The most common 2° cause is phosphate retention in chronic kidney disease, which leads to renal osteodystrophy. 3° hyperparathyroidism occurs when chronic 2° hyperparathyroidism progresses to an unregulated state, resulting in hypercalcemia. Most cases are asymptomatic, but signs and symptoms may be mild and include stones (nephrolithiasis), bones (bone pain, myalgias, arthralgias, fractures), abdominal groans (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, PUD, pancreatitis), and psychiatric overtones (fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances). Chronic renal insufficiency and gout are also associated with 1° hyperparathyroidism. Relative surgical criteria for hyperparathyroidism include age < 50, markedly ↓ bone mass, nephrolithiasis/renal insuff ciency, profoundly elevated serum calcium or life-threatening hypercalcemia, and urine calcium > 400 mg in 24 hours. Labs reveal hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercalciuria. Intact PTH is inappropriately ↑ relative to ionized calcium (see Table 2.3-5). Vitamin D deficiency may obscure mild cases. A radionuclide parathyroid scan may help with localization of an adenoma, although localization is not always necessary. Cancer is the most likely alternative diagnosis and must be ruled out, but with carcinoma PTH is usually < 25 pg/mL unless hyperparathyroidism is also present. Lithium and thiazides may exacerbate hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy if the patient is symptomatic or if certain criteria are met. For acute hypercalcemia, give IV fuids (with a loop diuretic in the setting of renal or heart failure), IV bisphosphonate, and calcitonin. Oral phosphate binders (aluminum hydroxide, calcium salts, sevelamer hydrochloride, and lanthanum carbonate) and dietary phosphate restriction are used in patients with 2° hyperparathyroidism regardless of dialysis status. Cinacalcet ↓ PTH as well as calcium and phosphate and may be a helpful adjunct in end-stage renal disease. Hypercalcemia is the most severe complication, presenting acutely with coma or altered mental status, bone disease, nephrolithiasis, and abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. The most common endogenous cause of Cushing’s syndrome is hypersecretion of ACTH from a pituitary adenoma (known as Cushing’s disease, or central hypercortisolism). Other endogenous causes include ectopic ACTH secretion from neoplasia (e.g., carcinoid tumor, small cell lung cancer) and excess adrenal secretion of cortisol (e.g., bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, adrenal cancer). The condition is most commonly iatrogenic, resulting from treatment with exogenous corticosteroids.', 'Are there any palpable masses or nodules? Each question must be answered (with the exclusion of all other inputs) before the examiner can move on to the next specific question. Each diagnostic hypothesis provides testable predictions and sets a context for the next question or step to follow. For example, if the enlarged and quite tender liver felt on physical examination is due to acute hepatitis (the hypothesis), certain specific liver function tests should be markedly elevated (the prediction). If the tests come back normal, the hypothesis may have to be discarded or substantially modified. Negative findings often are neglected but are as important as positive ones because they often reduce the likelihood of the diagnostic hypotheses under consideration. Chest discomfort that is not provoked or worsened by exertion in an active patient reduces the likelihood that chronic ischemic heart disease is the underlying cause. The absence of a resting tachycardia and thyroid gland enlargement reduces the likelihood of hyperthyroidism in a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

With complete loss of oculomotor function, the eyes remain in the center of the orbit regardless of any stimulation, indicating brainstem failure. Body posture at rest and after noxious stimulation can indicate the anatomic level responsible for the alteration of consciousness. Mildly altered mental status may be manifested by a comfortable sleeping posture. Frequent spontaneous readjustments of position, yawns, and sighs are observed. Patients who lie in a flat, extended, unvarying position with eyes half-open exhibit a deeper coma. An asymmetrical posture suggests motor dysfunction of one side. This asymmetry may be subtle, such as mild external rotation of the affected leg. Posturing in response to noxious stimulation indicates moreserious neurologic conditions. Decorticate posturing consists of rigid extension of the legs and feet, flexion and supinationof the arms, and fisting of the hands. It indicates bilateral cortical or subcortical abnormalities or herniation, with preservedbrainstem function. Decerebrate posturing (rigid extensionand internal rotation of legs and arms) indicates a midbrainabnormality and is classically associated with herniation ortoxic-metabolic abnormalities. These postures may be exhibitedunilaterally or bilaterally. A structural cause is likely when posturing is asymmetric, whereas symmetric posturing may bemore likely with underlying toxic-metabolic etiologies. The evolution of change in consciousness is an important clue to the etiology. A detailed history and physical examination usually provide sufficient clues to differentiate among the three major diagnostic categories producing coma: metabolic/toxic, infectious, and structural. In most clinical situations, the cause of coma is readily identified. Metabolic derangements are common causes of altered mental status. Disturbances of blood chemistries (glucose, sodium, calcium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, ammonia) may produce depressed mental status. Metabolic causes of acute coma are suggested by spontaneous fluctuations in the level of consciousness, tremors, myoclonus, asterixis, visual and tactile hallucinations, and deep coma with preservation of pupillary light reflexes. Acute metabolic or toxic disorders usually produce a hypotonic, limp state, but hypertonia, rigidity, and decorticate and decerebrate posturing are sometimes observed in coma caused by hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and short-acting barbiturates. A subacute course of somnolence progressing to difficulty arousing from a deep sleep (stupor) over hours suggests drug intoxication or organ system failure (kidney, liver) producing a metabolic encephalopathy. Care must be taken to investigate background medical conditions that may produce a decline in consciousness (e.g., diabetes mellitus, leukemia, kidney failure, liver disease). Intoxication and ingestion are common causes of acute alteration of consciousness, and a thorough history must be taken to search for the offending agent (Chapter 45). A history of social and emotional difficulties, drug abuse, or depression raises concern for self-inflicted injury or toxic ingestion. Central nervous system infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, usually causes abrupt alteration of mental status, althoughviral meningoencephalitis (particularly herpes simplex virus) canpresent with subacute alterations in mental status. The presenceof fever, petechiae, chills, and sweats suggests infection. Prodromal photophobia and pain on movement of the head or eyes aresymptoms of meningeal irritation. Premonitory symptoms, suchas abdominal pain, diarrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, cough, orrash, point toward viral encephalitis or a postinfectious syndromeas the cause of the altered consciousness. Structural processes, such as hemorrhage, infarction, or acute hydrocephalus, can cause sudden depressed consciousness in children. An evolution of headache and morning vomiting suggests increased intracranial pressure (ICP). A gradual fading of alertness or declining school performance over preceding weeks suggests an expanding intracranial mass, subdural hematoma, or chronic infection (e.g., tuberculous meningitis, human immunodeficiency virus). Deprivation of oxygen to the brain, caused by either deficient oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia) or deficient delivery of blood to the brain (ischemia), impairs consciousness. Papilledema or paralysis of cranial nerves III or VI in a patientwith depressed consciousness is strong evidence of elevatedICP, a medical and neurosurgical emergency. Herniations occur under the falx, through the tentorial notch, or into theforamen magnum (Table 184-2). Recognition of the signsassociated with the major herniation syndromes can be lifesaving, if emergent neuroimaging and treatment are initiated.Uncal herniation implies displacement of the mesial temporal lobe over the tentorial edge, producing a unilateral third\n\n\n\nTranstentorial Unilateral Supratentorial mass lesions, Downward displacement of supratentorial Headache (uncal) or bilateral diffuse brain swelling, brain tissue into infratentorial compartment Altered consciousness focal edema, or acute (below tentorium), compressing the cerebral Dilated ipsilateral pupil hydrocephalus peduncles, midbrain, third cranial nerve, and Cranial nerve III palsy posterior circulation Hemiparesis Decerebrate posturing Cushing triad Respiratory arrest nerve palsy (“blown pupil”) and hemiparesis (which can beipsilateral, because of compression of the contralateral cerebralpeduncle, or contralateral if the uncus compresses the ipsilateral peduncle). Transtentorial (or central) herniation occurs with gradual downward pressure from the diencephalonthrough the tentorium, resulting in compression of the brain-stem (first midbrain, then progressing to pons and medulla). Aprogressive loss of consciousness accompanied by a characteristic progression of motor, oculomotor, pupillary, and respiratory signs indicates incipient transtentorial herniation. Evaluation is guided by the history and physical examination(see Table 184-1). Computed tomography (CT) remains thepreferred imaging technique in emergency situations because itcan be performed rapidly and accurately identifies acute hemorrhages, large space-occupying lesions, edema, and shifts ofthe midline. The initial head CT scan is done without contrast to identify blood and calcifications. Contrast can be administered to identify inflammatory and neoplastic lesions, but is notusually required for identification of major lesions. Several metabolic derangements (hepatic encephalopathy, Reye syndrome,hyponatremia, lead encephalopathy, diabetic ketoacidosis, andhypoxic-ischemic injury) may give rise to severe elevations of ICPwithout producing obvious CT abnormalities. Lumbar puncture (LP) in a patient with elevated ICP can result in transtentorial herniation, so imaging should be performed before LP ifelevated ICP is suspected, especially if there are any focal neurological deficits on exam. If trauma or immersion injuries aresuspected, neck manipulation should be avoided until cervicalspine imaging excludes vertebral fracture or subluxation. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may establishthe cause of the alteration of consciousness. Appropriate neuroimaging should be performed to ensure that no added injury islikely to be inflicted with LP. The presence of red blood cells inthe CSF may suggest primary subarachnoid hemorrhage, parenchymal hemorrhage, or hemorrhagic infection (herpes simplexvirus), or it may be due to a traumatic procedure. White bloodcells in the CSF usually denote infectious meningitis or meningoencephalitis but may also be associated with vasculitis or parainfectious syndrome. Elevated CSF protein is seen in patientswith meningeal inflammation or tumors, and abnormal CSFglucose levels are also markers of infection and inflammation. The etiology of altered mental status determines the treatment.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['A more vigorous stimulus for ocular movements in coma is accomplished by irrigation of one ear with 10 mL of cold water (or room-temperature water if the patient is still arousable). This causes slow conjugate deviation of the eyes toward the irrigated ear, followed in a few seconds by compensatory nystagmus (fast component away from the stimulated side). This is the vestibulo-ocular (oculovestibular), or caloric test. The ears are irrigated separately several minutes apart. In comatose patients, the fast “corrective” phase of nystagmus that is mediated by the frontal lobes is lost and the eyes are tonically deflected to the side irrigated with cold water, or away from the side irrigated with warm water; this position may be held for 2 to 3 min.

B:Increasing sympathetic tone in systemic arteries
C:Decreasing the length of phase 4 of the SA node myocytes
D:Slowing conduction in the AV node
E:Decreasing the firing rate of carotid baroreceptors
","['18.4 ). Baroreceptors located in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses are responsible for this reflex (see the section ”). The inverse relationship between heart rate and arterial blood pressure is generally most pronounced over an intermediate range of arterial blood pressures. Below this intermediate range, the heart rate maintains a constant, high value; above this pressure range, the heart rate maintains a constant, low value. The effects of changes in carotid sinus pressure on the activity in cardiac autonomic nerves are described in\n\n\n\nFig. 18.5 , which shows that over an intermediate range of carotid sinus pressures (100 to 180 mm Hg), reciprocal changes are evoked in efferent vagal and sympathetic neural activity. Below this range of carotid sinus pressure, sympathetic activity is intense, and vagal activity is virtually absent. Conversely, above the intermediate range of carotid sinus pressure, vagal activity is intense and sympathetic activity is minimal. Bainbridge Reflex, Atrial Receptors, and Atrial Natriuretic Peptide\n\n\n\nIn 1915, Francis A. Bainbridge reported that infusing blood or saline into dogs accelerated their heart rate. This increase did not seem to be tied to arterial blood pressure because the heart rate rose regardless of whether arterial blood pressure did or did not change. However, Bainbridge also noted that the heart rate increased whenever central venous pressure rose sufficiently to distend the right side of the heart. This response is termed the Bainbridge reflex. Bilateral transection of the vagus nerves abolished this response. Many investigators have confirmed Bainbridge’s observations and have noted that the magnitude and direction of the response depend on the prevailing heart rate. When the heart rate is slow, intravenous infusions of blood or electrolyte solutions usually accelerate the heart. At more rapid heart rates, however, such infusions ordinarily slow the heart. What accounts for these different responses? Increases in blood volume not only evoke Bainbridge reflex but also activate other reflexes (of note, the baroreceptor reflex). These other reflexes tend to elicit opposite changes in heart rate. Therefore, changes in heart rate evoked by an alteration in blood volume are the result of these antagonistic reflex effects (\n\n\n\nFig. 18.6 ). Evidently, the Bainbridge reflex predominates over the baroreceptor reflex when blood volume rises, but the baroreceptor reflex prevails over the Bainbridge reflex when blood volume diminishes. •Fig. 18.4 Experimentaldatashowingthatheartratedecreasesasarterialpressureisincreased.(AdaptedfromCornishKG,etal.Am J Physiol. 1989;257:r595.)250 200 150 100 50 50 75 100 125 150 Arterial pressure (mm Hg) Heart rate (beats/min)\n\n\n\nBoth atria have receptors that are affected by changes in blood volume and that influence the heart rate. These receptors are located principally in the venoatrial junctions: in the right atrium at its junctions with the venae cavae and in the left atrium at its junctions with the pulmonary veins. Distention of these atrial receptors sends afferent impulses to the brainstem in the vagus nerves. The efferent impulses are carried from the brainstem to the SA node by fibers from both autonomic divisions. The cardiac response to these changes in autonomic neural activity is highly selective. Even when the reflex increase in heart rate is large, changes in ventricular contractility are generally negligible. Furthermore, the neurally induced increase in heart rate is not usually accompanied by an increase in sympathetic activity in the peripheral arterioles. •Fig. 18.5 Experimentaldatashowingthatincreasesincarotidsinuspressureresultindecreasedsympatheticefferentnerve(Symp)activityandincreasedcardiacvagalnerveactivity.(AdaptedfromKollaiM,KoizumiK.Pflügers Arch. 1989;413:365.)100 50 0 60 100 140 180 220 Sinus pressure (mm Hg) Vagal activity (% of max) 100 50 0 Symp. activity (% of max) •Fig. 18.6 Intravenous Infusions of Blood or Electrolyte Solutions Tend to Increase the Heart Rate Through the Bainbridge Reflex and to Decrease the Heart Rate Through the Baroreceptor Reflex.

Reduced activity in the renal sympathetic nerve fibers may partially account for this diuresis. However, the principal mechanism appears to be a neurally mediated reduction in vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) secretion by the posterior pituitary gland (see ). Stretch of the atrial walls also releases atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from the atria. ANP, a 28–amino acid peptide, exerts potent diuretic and natriuretic effects on the kidneys (see also ) and vasodilator effects on the resistance and capacitance vessels. Thus ANP is an important regulator of blood volume and blood pressure.

Rhythmic variations in heart rate, occurring at the frequency of respiration, are detectable in most individuals and tend to be more pronounced in children. The heart rate typically accelerates during inspiration and decelerates during expiration (Fig. 18.7 *The myocytes of the ventricles secrete a related peptide in response to stretch. This peptide, termed brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) because of its initial discovery in the central nervous system, has actions similar to those of ANP (see •Fig. 18.7 Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia.', 'Upon completion of this chapter, the student should be able to answer the following questions: 1. How do the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems regulate the functions of heart and vasculature? 2. What factors affect the differential sympathetic regulation of resistance and capacitance vessels? 3. How does the baroreceptor-mediated reflex mimic the operation of skeletal muscle proprioceptor reflex? 4. What are the two major mechanisms, intrinsic to heart muscle, that regulate myocardial performance? 5. What are the major hormones that regulate myocardial performance? 6. How is myocardial performance affected by changes in the arterial blood concentrations of O2, CO2, and H+? 7. What is the myogenic mechanism of vascular smooth muscle, and how does it participate in regulation of tissue blood flow? 8. What are the humoral factors that participate in regulation of blood flow, and what are their actions? Regulation of Heart Rate and Myocardial Performance\n\n\n\nCardiac output is defined as the quantity of blood pumped by the heart each minute. Cardiac output may be varied by a change in the heart rate or the volume of blood ejected from either ventricle with each heartbeat; this volume is called the stroke volume. Mathematically, cardiac output (CO) can be expressed as the product of heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV):\n\n\n\nEquation 18.1\n\n\n\nThus to understand how cardiac activity is controlled, consider how the heart rate and stroke volume are regulated. Heart rate is regulated by the activity of the autonomic nervous system to modulate the intrinsic cardiac pacemaker. Stroke volume is determined by myocardial performance (which is determined by cardiac cell contractility) and by the hemodynamic loads on the heart. All of these determinants are interdependent, inasmuch as a change in one determinant of cardiac output almost invariably alters another. Nervous Control of the Heart Rate\n\n\n\nAlthough certain local factors, such as temperature changes and stretching of tissue, can affect the heart rate, the autonomic nervous system is the principal means by which the heart rate is controlled. The average resting heart rate is approximately 70 beats per minute in normal adults, and it is significantly faster in children. During sleep, the heart rate decreases by 10 to 20 beats per minute. It may increase during emotional excitement, and during muscular exercise, it may increase to rates well above 150 beats per minute. In well-trained athletes, the usual resting rate is only approximately 50 beats per minute. Both divisions of the autonomic nervous system tonically influence the cardiac pacemaker, which is normally the sinoatrial (SA) node. The sympathetic nervous system enhances automaticity, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system inhibits it. Changes in heart rate usually involve a reciprocal action of these two divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Thus the heart rate ordinarily increases with a combined decrease in parasympathetic activity and increase in sympathetic activity; the heart rate decreases with the opposite changes in autonomic neural activity. Parasympathetic tone usually predominates in healthy, resting individuals. When a resting individual is given atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist that blocks parasympathetic effects, the heart rate generally increases substantially. If a resting individual is given propranolol, a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist that blocks sympathetic effects, the heart rate usually decreases only slightly (\n\n\n\nFig. 18.1 ). When both divisions of the autonomic nervous system are blocked, the heart rate of young adults averages approximately 100 beats per minute. The rate that prevails after complete autonomic blockade is called the intrinsic heart rate. •Fig. 18.1 Effectsoffourequaldosesofatropine(muscarinicrecep (β-adrenergicreceptorantagonistthatblockssympatheticeffects)ontheheartratesof10healthyyoungmen.Inhalfthetrials,atropine wasgivenfirst(top curve); intheotherhalf,propranololwasgivenfirst(bottom curve).

(ModifiedfromWarnerHR,CoxA.J Appl Physiol. 1962;17:349.)\n\n\n\nThe cardiac parasympathetic fibers originate in the medulla oblongata, in cells that lie in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve or in the nucleus ambiguus (see ). In humans, centrifugal vagal fibers pass inferiorly through the neck near the common carotid arteries and then through the mediastinum to synapse with postganglionic vagal cells. These cells are located either on the epicardial surface or within the walls of the heart. Most of the vagal ganglion cells are located in epicardial fat pads near the SA and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. The right and left vagus nerves are distributed to different cardiac structures. The right vagus nerve affects the SA node predominantly; stimulation of this nerve slows SA nodal firing and can even stop the firing for several seconds. The left vagus nerve mainly inhibits AV conduction tissue to produce various degrees of AV block (see ). However, the distribution of the efferent vagal fibers is overlapping in such a way that left vagal stimulation also •Fig. 18.3 Changes in Heart Rate When the Vagus and Cardiac\n\n\n\nSympathetic Nerves Are Stimulated Simultaneously. Thesympa depresses the SA node and right vagal stimulation impedes AV conduction. The SA and AV nodes are rich in acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that rapidly hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The effects of a given vagal stimulus decay very quickly (\n\n\n\nFig. 18.2A ) when vagal stimulation is discontinued because ACh is rapidly destroyed. In addition, vagal effects on SA and AV nodal function have a very short latency (≈50 to 100 msec) because the ACh released quickly activates special ACh-regulated potassium (KACh) channels in the cardiac cells. These channels open quickly because the muscarinic receptor is coupled directly to the KACh channel by a guanine nucleotide–binding protein. These two features of the vagus nerves—brief latency and rapid theticnerveswerestimulatedat0,2,and4Hzinthepresenceofvagalnervestimulation(Vag)at0,4,and8Hz.(ModifiedfromLevyMN,ZieskeH.J Appl Physiol. 1969;27:465.) decay of the response—enable them to exert beat-by-beat control of SA and AV nodal function. Parasympathetic influences usually predominate over sympathetic effects at the SA node, as shown in\n\n\n\nFig. 18.3 . When the frequency of sympathetic stimulation increases from 0 to 4 Hz, the heart rate increases by approximately 80 beats per minute in the absence of vagal nerve stimulation (0 Hz). However, when the vagus nerves are stimulated at 8 Hz, increasing the sympathetic stimulation frequency from 0 to 4 Hz has only a negligible influence on heart rate. The cardiac sympathetic fibers originate in the intermediolateral columns of the upper five or six thoracic segments and the lower one or two cervical segments of the spinal cord (see ). These fibers emerge from the spinal column through the white communicating branches and enter the paravertebral chains of ganglia. The preganglionic and postganglionic neurons synapse mainly in the stellate or middle cervical ganglia, depending on the species. In the mediastinum, postganglionic sympathetic and preganglionic parasympathetic fibers join to form a complicated plexus of mixed efferent nerves to the heart. The postganglionic cardiac sympathetic fibers in this plexus approach the base of the heart along the adventitial surface of the great vessels. From the base of the heart, these fibers are distributed to the various chambers as an extensive epicardial plexus. They then penetrate the myocardium, usually accompanying the coronary vessels. In contrast to abrupt termination of the response after vagal activity, the effects of sympathetic stimulation decay gradually after stimulation is stopped (see\n\n\n\nFig. 18.2B ). Nerve terminals take up to 70% of the norepinephrine released during sympathetic stimulation; much of the remainder is carried away by the bloodstream. These processes are slow. Furthermore, the facilitatory effects of sympathetic stimulation on the heart attain steady-state values much more slowly than do the inhibitory effects of vagal stimulation. The onset of the cardiac response to sympathetic stimulation begins slowly for two main reasons. First, norepinephrine appears to be released slowly from the sympathetic nerve terminals. Second, the cardiac effects of the neurally released norepinephrine are mediated mainly by a relatively slow second messenger system involving cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP; see ). Hence, sympathetic activity alters the heart rate and AV conduction much more slowly than vagal activity does. Whereas vagal activity can exert beat-by-beat control of cardiac function, sympathetic activity cannot. Stimulation of various brain regions can have significant effects on cardiac rate, rhythm, and contractility (see ). In the cerebral cortex, centers that regulate cardiac function are located in the anterior half of the brain, principally in the frontal lobe, the orbital cortex, the motor and premotor cortex, the anterior portion of the temporal lobe, the insula, and the cingulate gyrus. Stimulation of the midline, ventral, and medial nuclei of the thalamus elicits tachycardia. Stimulation of the posterior and posterolateral regions of the hypothalamus can also change the heart rate. Stimuli applied to the H2 field of Forel in the posterior hypothalamus evoke various cardiovascular responses, including tachycardia and associated limb movements; these changes resemble those observed during muscular exercise. Undoubtedly, the cortical and hypothalamic centers initiate the cardiac reactions that occur during excitement, anxiety, and other emotional states. The hypothalamic centers also initiate the cardiac response to alterations in environmental temperature. Experimentally induced temperature changes in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus alter the heart rate and peripheral resistance. Stimulation of the parahypoglossal area of the medulla reciprocally activates cardiac sympathetic pathways and inhibits cardiac parasympathetic pathways. In certain dorsal regions of the medulla, distinct cardiac accelerator sites (increase the heart rate) and augmentor sites (increase cardiac contractility) have been detected in animals with transected vagus nerves. The accelerator regions are more abundant on the right side, whereas the augmentor sites are more prevalent on the left. A similar distribution also exists in the hypothalamus. Therefore, the sympathetic fibers mainly descend ipsilaterally through the brainstem.

However, this high cardiac output causes an increase in the net transfer of blood from the veins to the arteries of the circuit, and as a consequence, Pv subsequently begins to fall (to point C). The reduction in Pv then leads to a small decrease in cardiac output. However, cardiac output is still sufficiently high to effect •Fig. 19.8 Duringelectricalstimulationofthecardiacsympatheticnervefibers,aorticbloodflow(cardiacoutput)increased,whereaspressuresintheleftatrium(PLA)andrightatrium(PRA)diminished.Thesedataconformtotheconclusionsderivedfrom', 'Fig. 18.2B ).

","['All symptomatic body sites must be carefully evaluated. The choice of antimicrobial agents to treat both coagulasepositive and coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections has become increasingly problematic because of the prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains. Staphylococcal resistance to most antibiotic families, including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and (to a lesser extent) glycopeptides, has increased. This trend is more apparent with CoNS: >80% of nosocomial isolates are resistant to methicillin, and these methicillin-resistant strains are usually resistant to most other antibiotics as well. Because the selection of antimicrobial agents for S. aureus infections is similar to that for CoNS infections, treatment options for these pathogens are discussed together and are summarized in Table 172-3. As a result of the widespread dissemination of plasmids containing the enzyme penicillinase, few strains of staphylococci (≤5%) remain susceptible to penicillin. However, penicillin remains the drug of choice against susceptible strains if the laboratory can reliably test for penicillin susceptibility. Penicillin-resistant isolates are treated with semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillins (SPRPs), such as oxacillin or nafcillin. Methicillin, the first of the SPRPs, is now used infrequently. Cephalosporins are alternative therapeutic agents for these infections. Secondand third-generation cephalosporins do not offer a therapeutic advantage over first-generation cephalosporins for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. The carbapenems have excellent activity against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus but not against MRSA. The isolation of MRSA was reported within 1 year of the introduction of methicillin. Since then, the prevalence of MRSA has steadily increased. In many hospitals, 40–50% of S. aureus isolates are now resistant to methicillin. Resistance to methicillin indicates resistance to all SPRPs as well as to all cephalosporins (except ceftaroline). Production of a novel penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) is responsible for methicillin resistance. This protein is synthesized by the mecA gene, which (as stated above) is part of a large mobile genetic element—a pathogenicity or genomic island—called SCCmec. It is hypothesized that this genetic material was acquired via horizontal transfer from a related staphylococcal species, such as Staphylococcus sciuri. Phenotypic expression of methicillin resistance may be constitutive (i.e., expressed in all organisms in a population) or heterogeneous (i.e., displayed by only a proportion of the total organism population). Detection of methicillin resistance in the clinical microbiology laboratory can be difficult if the strain expresses heterogeneous resistance. Therefore, susceptibility studies are routinely performed at reduced temperatures (≤35°C for 24 h), with increased concentrations of salt in the medium to enhance the expression of resistance. In addition to PCR-based techniques, a number of rapid methods for the detection of methicillin resistance have been developed. In light of decreasing susceptibility of MRSA isolates to vancomycin, both vancomycin and daptomycin are now recommended as the drugs of choice for the treatment of MRSA infections. Vancomycin is less effective than SPRPs for the treatment of infections due to methicillin-susceptible strains. Alternatives to SPRPs should be used only after careful consideration in patients with a history of serious β-lactam allergies. Three types of staphylococcal resistance to vancomycin have 961 emerged. (1) Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) “creep” refers to the incremental increase in vancomycin MICs that has been detected in various geographic areas. Studies suggest that infections due to S. aureus strains with vancomycin MICs of >1 μg/mL may not respond as well to vancomycin therapy as those due to strains with MICs of <1 μg/mL. Some authorities (e.g., The Medical Letter) have recommended choosing an alternative agent in this setting. (2) In 1997, an S. aureus strain with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA]) was reported from Japan. Subsequently, additional VISA clinical isolates were reported. These strains were all resistant to methicillin and many other antimicrobial agents. The VISA strains appear to evolve (under vancomycin selective pressure) from strains that are susceptible to vancomycin but are heterogeneous, with a small proportion of the bacterial population expressing the resistance phenotype. The mechanism of VISA resistance is in part due to an abnormally thick cell wall. Vancomycin is trapped by the abnormal peptidoglycan cross-linking and is unable to gain access to its target site. (3) In 2002, the first clinical isolate of fully vancomycin-resistant S. aureus was reported. Resistance in this and several additional clinical isolates was due to the presence of vanA, the gene responsible for expression of vancomycin resistance in enterococci. This observation suggested that resistance was acquired as a result of horizontal conjugal transfer from a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecalis. Several patients had both MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci cultured from infection sites. The vanA gene is respon sible for the synthesis of the dipeptide D-Ala-D-Lac in place of D-AlaD-Ala. Vancomycin cannot bind to the altered peptide. Daptomycin, a parenteral bactericidal agent with antistaphylococcal activity, is approved for the treatment of bacteremia (including right-sided endocarditis) and complicated skin infections. It is not effective in respiratory infections. This drug has a novel mechanism of action: it disrupts the cytoplasmic membrane. Staphylococcal resistance to daptomycin, sometimes developing during therapy, has been reported. Linezolid—the first oxazolidinone—is bacteriostatic against staphylococci and offers the advantage of comparable bioavailability after oral or parenteral administration. Cross-resistance with other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been detected. However, resistance to linezolid has been reported. Serious adverse reactions to linezolid include thrombocytopenia, occasional cases of neutropenia, and rare instances of peripheral and optic neuropathy. Tedizolid, a second oxazolidinone released in 2014, is available as both oral and parenteral preparations. It has enhanced in vitro activity against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococci. Tedizolid is administered once a day. Ceftaroline is a fifth-generation cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against MRSA (including strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and daptomycin). It is approved for use in nosocomial pneumonias and for skin and soft tissue infections. The parenteral streptogramin antibiotic quinupristin/dalfopristin displays bactericidal activity against all staphylococci, including VISA strains. This drug has been used successfully to treat serious MRSA infections. In cases of resistance to erythromycin or clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin is bacteriostatic against staphylococci. There are limited data on the efficacy of either quinupristin/dalfopristin or linezolid for the treatment of infective endocarditis. Telavancin is a parenteral lipoglycopeptide derivative of vancomycin that is approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and for nosocomial pneumonia.

","['Education may improve compliance, particularly with ICS. 1679 All patients should be taught how to use their inhalers correctly. In particular, they need to understand how to recognize worsening of asthma and how to step up therapy. Written action plans have been shown to reduce hospital admissions and morbidity rates in adults and children, and are recommended particularly in patients with unstable disease who have frequent exacerbations. Exacerbations of asthma are feared by patients and may be life threatening. One of the main aims of controller therapy is to prevent exacerbations; in this respect, ICS and combination inhalers are very effective. Clinical Features Patients are aware of increasing chest tightness, wheezing, and dyspnea that are often not or poorly relieved by their usual reliever inhaler. In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax. A high concentration of oxygen should be given by face mask to achieve oxygen saturation of >90%. The mainstay of treatment are high doses of SABA given either by nebulizer or via a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer. In severely ill patients with impending respiratory failure, IV β2-agonists may be given. A nebulized anticholinergic may be added if there is not a satisfactory response to β2-agonists alone, as there are additive effects. In patients who are refractory to inhaled therapies, a slow infusion of aminophylline may be effective, but it is important to monitor blood levels, especially if patients have already been treated with oral theophylline. Magnesium sulfate given intravenously or by nebulizer is effective when added to inhaled β2-agonists, and is relatively well tolerated but is not routinely recommended. Prophylactic intubation may be indicated for impending respiratory failure, when the PCO2 is normal or rises. For patients with respiratory failure, it is necessary to intubate and institute ventilation. These patients may benefit from an anesthetic such as halothane if they have not responded to conventional bronchodilators. Sedatives should never be given because they may depress ventilation. Antibiotics should not be used routinely unless there are signs of pneumonia. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Refractory Asthma Although most patients with asthma are easily controlled with appropriate medication, a small proportion of patients (approximately 5–10% of asthmatics) are difficult to control despite maximal inhaled therapy. Some of these patients will require maintenance treatment with OCS. In managing these patients, it is important to investigate and correct any mechanisms that may be aggravating asthma. There are two major patterns of difficult asthma: some patients have persistent symptoms and poor lung function, despite appropriate therapy, whereas others may have normal or near-normal lung function but intermittent, severe (sometimes life-threatening) exacerbations. MECHANISMS The most common reason for poor control of asthma is noncompliance with medication, particularly ICS. Compliance with ICS may be low because patients do not feel any immediate clinical benefit or may be concerned about side effects. Compliance with ICS is difficult to monitor because there are no useful plasma measurements that can be made, but measuring the fractional excretion of 1680 induced NO (FENO) may identify the problem. Compliance may be improved by giving the ICS as a combination with a LABA that gives symptom relief. Compliance with OCS may be measured by suppression of plasma cortisol and the expected concentration of prednisone/ prednisolone in the plasma. There are several factors that may make asthma more difficult to control, including exposure to high, ambient levels of allergens or unidentified occupational agents. Severe rhino-sinusitis may make asthma more difficult to control; upper airway disease should be vigorously treated. Drugs such as beta-adrenergic blockers, aspirin, and other cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors may worsen asthma. Some women develop severe premenstrual worsening of asthma, which is unresponsive to corticosteroids and requires treatment with progesterone or gonadotropin-releasing factors. Few systemic diseases make asthma more difficult to control, but hyper-and hypothyroidism may increase asthma symptoms and should be investigated if suspected. Bronchial biopsy studies in refractory asthma may show the typical eosinophilic pattern of inflammation, whereas others have a predominantly neutrophilic pattern. There may be an increase in TH1 cells, TH17 cells, and CD8 lymphocytes compared to mild asthma and increased expression of TNF-α. Structural changes in the airway, including fibrosis, angiogenesis, and airway smooth-muscle thickening, are more commonly seen in these patients. Corticosteroid-Resistant Asthma A few patients with asthma show a poor response to corticosteroid therapy and may have various molecular abnormalities that impair the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. Complete resistance to corticosteroids is extremely uncommon and affects less than 1 in 1000 patients. It is defined by a failure to respond to a high dose of oral prednisone/prednisolone (40 mg once daily over 2 weeks), ideally with a 2-week run-in with matched placebo. More common is reduced responsiveness to corticosteroids where control of asthma requires OCS (corticosteroiddependent asthma). In patients with poor responsiveness to corticosteroids, there is a reduction in the response of circulating monocytes and lymphocytes to the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids in vitro and reduced skin blanching in response to topical corticosteroids. There are several mechanisms that have been described, including an increase in the alternatively spliced form of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-β, an abnormal pattern of histone acetylation in response to corticosteroids, a defect in IL-10 production, and a reduction in HDAC2 activity (as in COPD). These observations suggest that there are likely to be heterogeneous mechanisms for corticosteroid resistance; whether these mechanisms are genetically determined has yet to be decided. Brittle Asthma Some patients show chaotic variations in lung function despite taking appropriate therapy. Some show a persistent pattern of variability and may require oral corticosteroids or, at times, continuous infusion of β2-agonists (type 1 brittle asthma), whereas others have generally normal or near-normal lung function but precipitous, unpredictable falls in lung function that may result in death (type 2 brittle asthma). These latter patients are difficult to manage because they do not respond well to corticosteroids, and the worsening of asthma does not reverse well with inhaled bronchodilators. The most effective therapy is subcutaneous epinephrine, which suggests that the worsening is likely to be a localized airway anaphylactic reaction with edema. In some of these patients, there may be allergy to specific foods.', 'Galanter, MD, & Homer A. Boushey, MD and respirations are 32/min. Her mother states that she has used her albuterol inhaler several times a day for the past 3 days and twice during the previous night.

She appears frightened and refuses to lie down but is not cyanotic. Her pulse is 120 bpm,\n\n\n\nA consistent increase in the prevalence of asthma over the past 60 years has made it an extraordinarily common disease. The reasons for this increase—most striking in people under 18 years of age and shared across all modern, “Westernized” societies—are poorly understood. The global estimate of the number of affected individuals is 300 million. In the United States alone, 17.7 million adults (7.4% of the population) and 6.3 million children (8.6% of the population) have asthma. The condition accounts for 10.5 million outpatient visits, 1.8 million emergency department visits, and 439,000 hospitalizations each year. Considering the disease’s prevalence, the annual mortality in the USA is low— around 3500 deaths—but many of these deaths are considered preventable, and the number has not changed much despite improvements in treatment. The clinical features of asthma are recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing, often associated with coughing. Its hallmark pathophysiologic features are widespread, reversible narrowing of the bronchial airways and a marked increase in bronchial responsiveness to inhaled stimuli. Its pathologic features are lymphocytic, eosinophilic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. These changes are accompanied by “remodeling” of the bronchial wall, with thickening of the lamina reticularis beneath the epithelium and hyperplasia of the bronchial vasculature, smooth muscle, secretory glands, and goblet cells. In mild asthma, symptoms occur only intermittently, as on exposure to allergens or airway irritants such as air pollution or tobacco smoke, on exercise, or after viral upper respiratory infection. More severe forms of asthma are associated with more frequent and severe symptoms, especially at night. Chronic airway constriction causes persistent respiratory impairment, punctuated by periodic asthma exacerbations marked by acute worsening of symptoms. These attacks are most often associated with viral respiratory infections and are characterized by severe airflow obstruction from intense contraction of airway smooth muscle, inspissation of mucus plugs in the airway lumen, and thickening of the bronchial mucosa from edema and inflammatory cell infiltration. The spectrum of asthma’s severity is wide, and patients are classified based on two domains: impairment and risk. Measures of impairment are based on the frequency and severity of symptoms, the severity of airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing, and the intensity of therapy required for maintenance of asthma control. Measures of risk are based on susceptibility to asthma exacerbations. Based on measures of impairment, patients may be classified as having “mild intermittent,” “mild persistent,” “moderate persistent,” or “severe persistent” asthma, but will be classified in a more severe category if their history indicates they are prone to frequent or severe exacerbations (“exacerbationprone” versus “exacerbation-resistant”). Until recently, the entire range of asthma severity was regarded as eminently treatable, because treatments for quick relief of symptoms of acute bronchoconstriction (“short-term relievers”) and treatments for reduction in symptoms and prevention of attacks, especially using inhaled corticosteroids (“long-term controllers”), had been shown to be effective in many large, well-designed randomized clinical trials, pragmatic clinical trials, observational studies, and evidence-based reviews. The persistence of high medical costs for asthma, driven largely by the costs of emergency department and hospital treatment of asthma exacerbations, was thus believed to reflect underutilization of the treatments available. Reconsideration of this view was driven by recognition that the term “asthma” is applied to a variety of different disorders sharing common clinical features but fundamentally different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Attention has thus turned to the possibility that there are different asthma phenotypes, some of which are less responsive to the current mainstays of asthma controller therapy. The current view of asthma treatment may be summarized as follows: that the treatments commonly used at present are indeed effective for the most common form of the disease, as it presents in children and young adults with allergic asthma, but that there are other phenotypes of asthma for which these therapies are less effective, and that represent an unmet medical need. Accordingly, this chapter first reviews the pathophysiology of the most common form of asthma (classic allergic asthma) and the basic pharmacology of the agents used in its treatment. This is followed by a discussion of different forms or phenotypes of asthma and the efforts to develop effective therapies for them. Classic allergic asthma is regarded as mediated by immune globulin (IgE), produced in response to exposure to foreign proteins, like those from house dust mite, cockroach, animal danders, molds, and pollens. These qualify as allergens on the basis of their induction of IgE antibody production in people exposed to them. The tendency to produce IgE is at least in part genetically determined, and asthma clusters with other allergic diseases (allergic rhinitis, eczema, food allergy) in family groups. Once produced, IgE binds to high-affinity receptors (FCεR-1) on mast cells in the airway mucosa (Figure 20–1), so that re-exposure to the allergen triggers the release of mediators stored in the mast cells’ granules and the synthesis and release of other mediators. The histamine, tryptase, leukotrienes C4 and D4, and prostaglandin D2 released cause the smooth muscle contraction and vascular leakage responsible for the acute bronchoconstriction of the “early asthmatic response.” This response is often followed in 3–6 hours by a second, more sustained phase of bronchoconstriction, the “late asthmatic response,” associated with an influx of inflammatory cells into the bronchial mucosa and with an increase in bronchial reactivity. This late response is thought to be due to cytokines characteristically produced by T2 lymphocytes, especially interleukins (IL) 5, 9, and 13. These cytokines are thought to attract and activate eosinophils, stimulate IgE production by B lymphocytes, and stimulate mucus production by bronchial epithelial cells. It is not clear whether lymphocytes or mast cells in the airway mucosa are the primary source of the mediators responsible for the late inflammatory response, but the benefits of corticosteroid therapy are attributed to their inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the airways and of the response of airway epithelial cells to them. A major limitation to this classic conception of asthma as an allergic disease is that it applies only to a subgroup of patients with asthma, those with evidence of allergy. Allergic asthma accounts for a great proportion of asthma that develops in childhood, but a smaller proportion of adult-onset asthma. This is implied by the use of modifying terms to describe asthma in different patients, such as “extrinsic” versus “intrinsic,” “aspirin-sensitive,” “adult-onset,” “postviral,” and “obesity-related.” The allergen challenge model fails to account for all the features of the condition even in allergic asthmatics. Many pathways and mechanisms other than production of IgE and activation of mast cell degranulation are involved in asthma’s pathogenesis (Figure 20–2), and most asthma attacks are not triggered by inhalation of allergens, but instead by viral respiratory infections. Asthmatic bronchospasm can also be provoked by nonallergenic stimuli such as distilled water aerosol, exercise, cold air, cigarette smoke, and sulfur dioxide. This tendency to develop bronchospasm on encountering nonallergenic stimuli—assessed by measuring the fall in maximal expiratory flow provoked by inhaling serially increasing concentrations of the aerosolized cholinergic agonist methacholine—is described as “bronchial hyperreactivity.” It is considered fundamental to asthma’s pathogenesis because it is nearly ubiquitous in patients with asthma, and its degree roughly correlates with the clinical severity of the disease. The mechanisms underlying bronchial hyperreactivity are incompletely understood but appear to be related to inflammation of the airway mucosa. The anti-inflammatory activity of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment is credited with preventing the increase in bronchial reactivity associated with the late asthmatic response (Figure 20–1). Whatever the mechanisms responsible for bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchoconstriction itself results not simply from the direct effect of the released mediators but also from their activation of neural pathways. This is suggested by the effectiveness of muscarinic receptor antagonists, which have no direct effect on smooth muscle contractility, in inhibiting the bronchoconstriction caused by inhalation of allergens and airway irritants. The hypothesis suggested by this conceptual model—that asthmatic bronchospasm results from a combination of release of mediators and an exaggeration of responsiveness to their effects— predicts that drugs with different modes of action may effectively treat asthma. The bronchospasm provoked by exposure to allergens might be reversed or prevented, for example, by drugs that reduce the amount of IgE bound to mast cells (anti-IgE antibody), reduce the number and activity of eosinophils in the airway mucosa (antiIL-5 antibody), block the receptor for IL-4 and IL-13 (anti-IL-4α receptor antibody), prevent mast cell degranulation (cromolyn or nedocromil, sympathomimetic agents, calcium channel blockers), block the action of the products released (antihistamines and\n\n\n\nFIGURE 20–1 Conceptual model for the immunopathogenesis of asthma. Exposure to allergen causes synthesis of IgE, which binds to mast cells in the airway mucosa. On re-exposure to allergen, antigen-antibody interaction on mast cell surfaces triggers release of mediators of anaphylaxis: histamine, tryptase, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), leukotriene (LT) C4, and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These agents provoke contraction of airway smooth muscle, causing the immediate fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Re-exposure to allergen also causes the synthesis and release of a variety of cytokines: interleukins (IL) 4 and 5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and tissue growth factor (TGF) from T cells and mast cells. These cytokines in turn attract and activate eosinophils and neutrophils, whose products include eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), major basic protein (MBP), proteases, and platelet-activating factor. These mediators cause the edema, mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle contraction, and increase in bronchial reactivity associated with the late asthmatic response, indicated by a second fall in FEV1 3–6 hours after the exposure. leukotriene receptor antagonists), or interfere with the action of inflammatory cytokines (anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies). Other drugs that might be expected to be effective in all forms of asthma are those that relax airway smooth muscle (sympathomimetic agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors) or inhibit the effect of acetylcholine released from vagal motor nerves (muscarinic antagonists, also described as anticholinergic agents). Another approach to asthma treatment is aimed at reducing the level of bronchial responsiveness. Because increased responsiveness appears to be linked to airway inflammation and because airway inflammation is a feature of late asthmatic responses, this strategy is implemented both by reducing exposure to the allergens that provoke inflammation and by prolonged therapy with anti-inflammatory agents, especially inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). This therapy, once expected to be effective for all forms of asthma, is now recognized to be more effective for allergic than nonallergic asthma (see Future Directions of Asthma Therapy below). The drugs most used for asthma management are adrenoceptor agonists or sympathomimetic agents (used as “relievers” or bronchodilators) and inhaled corticosteroids (used as “controllers” or anti-inflammatory agents).

Airway epithelial cells exposed to activation stimuli, including allergens, viruses, and irritants, release cytokines that promote dendritic cell (DC) mobilization to draining lymph nodes, where they present antigens and thereby activate naive CD4 T cells. These T cells then induce B-cell class switching and maturation into plasma cells, which produce IgE. TH2 cells also migrate into the airway subepithelial mucosa, where they release inflammatory cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, which induce goblet cell metaplasia and mucus production, and act as a chemokine for eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils. Unbound IgE secreted by plasma cells binds the FcεRI receptor on submucosal mast cells and basophils and, when crosslinked by an antigen, induces the release of preformed mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes, as well as the release of inflammatory cytokines. (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Fahy JV: Type 2 inflammation in asthma: Present in most, absent in many. Nat Rev Immunol 2015;15:57.) elsewhere (see Chapters 9 and 39). In this chapter, we review their pharmacology relevant to asthma. Adrenoceptor agonists are mainstays in the treatment of asthma. Their binding to β-adrenergic receptors—abundant on airway smooth muscle cells—stimulates adenylyl cyclase and increases the formation of intracellular cAMP (Figure 20–3), thereby relaxing airway smooth muscle and inhibiting release of bronchoconstricting mediators from mast cells. They may also inhibit microvascular leakage and increase mucociliary transport. Adverse effects, especially of adrenoceptor agonists that activate β1 as well as β2 receptors, include tachycardia, skeletal muscle tremor, and decreases in serum potassium levels. Sympathomimetic agents now widely used in the treatment of asthma include albuterol and other β2-selective agents (Figure 20–4). The place of epinephrine and isoproterenol has markedly diminished because of their effects on the rate and force of cardiac contraction (mediated mainly by β1 receptors). In general, β-adrenoceptor agonists are best delivered by inhalation. This results in the greatest local effect on airway smooth muscle with the least systemic toxicity. Aerosol deposition depends on the particle size, the pattern of breathing, and the geometry of the airways. Even with particles in the optimal size range of 2–5 μm, 80–90% of the total dose of aerosol is deposited in the mouth or pharynx. Particles under 1–2 μm remain suspended and may be exhaled. Bronchial deposition of an aerosol is increased by\n\n\n\nFIGURE 20–3 Bronchodilation is promoted by cAMP. Intracellular levels of cAMP can be increased by β-adrenoceptor agonists, which increase the rate of its synthesis by adenylyl cyclase (AC), or by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as theophylline, which slow the rate of its degradation. Bronchoconstriction can be inhibited by muscarinic antagonists and possibly by adenosine antagonists. slow inhalation of a nearly full breath and by 5 or more seconds of breath-holding at the end of inspiration. Epinephrine is an effective, rapidly acting bronchodilator when injected subcutaneously (0.4 mL of 1:1000 solution) or inhaled as a microaerosol from a pressurized canister (320 mcg per puff). Maximal bronchodilation is achieved within 15 minutes after inhalation and lasts 60–90 minutes. Because epinephrine stimulates α and β1 as well as β2 receptors, tachycardia, arrhythmias, and worsening of angina pectoris are potentially serious adverse effects. Its current use is thus largely for treatment of the acute vasodilation and bronchospasm of anaphylaxis. Aerosol delivery of other, more β-selective agents has largely displaced its use in asthma (see below). Ephedrine was used in China for more than 2000 years before its introduction into Western medicine in 1924. Compared with epinephrine, ephedrine has a longer duration, oral activity, more pronounced central effects, and much lower potency. Because of the development of more efficacious and\n\n\n\nFIGURE 20–4 Structures of isoproterenol and several β2-selective analogs. β2-selective agonists, ephedrine is now used infrequently in treating asthma. Isoproterenol is a potent nonselective β1 and β2 bronchodilator. When inhaled as a microaerosol from a pressurized canister, 80–120 mcg isoproterenol causes maximal bronchodilation within 5 minutes and has a 60to 90-minute duration of action. An increase in asthma mortality in the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s was attributed to cardiac arrhythmias resulting from the use of high doses of inhaled isoproterenol. As a result of the availability and efficacy of β2-selective agonists, these have displaced the use of isoproterenol for asthma. The β2-selective adrenoceptor agonist drugs, particularly albuterol, are now the most widely used sympathomimetics for the treatment of acute bronchoconstriction (Figure 20–4).

","['Abnormal vital signs provide diagnostic clues and determine the need for acute intervention. Fever suggests inflammation or neoplasm. Orthostasis is found with significant blood loss, dehydration, sepsis, or autonomic neuropathy. Skin, eye, or joint findings may point to specific diagnoses. Neck exam with swallowing assessment evaluates dysphagia. Cardiopulmonary disease may present with abdominal pain or nausea; thus lung and cardiac exams are important. Pelvic examination tests for a gynecologic source of abdominal pain. Rectal exam may detect blood, indicating gut mucosal injury or neoplasm or a palpable inflammatory mass in appendicitis. Metabolic conditions and gut motor disorders have associated peripheral neuropathy. Inspection of the abdomen may reveal distention from obstruction, tumor, or ascites or vascular abnormalities with liver disease. Ecchymoses develop with severe pancreatitis. Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers. Laboratory, radiographic, and functional tests can assist in diagnosis of suspected GI disease. The GI tract also is amenable to internal evaluation with upper and lower endoscopy and to examination of luminal contents. Histopathologic exams of GI tissues complement these tests. Laboratory Selected laboratory tests facilitate the diagnosis of GI disease. Iron-deficiency anemia suggests mucosal blood loss, whereas vitamin B12 deficiency results from small-intestinal, gastric, or pancreatic disease. Either also can result from inadequate oral intake. Leukocytosis and increased sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels are found in inflammatory conditions, whereas leukopenia is seen in viremic illness. Severe vomiting or diarrhea elicits electrolyte disturbances, acid-base abnormalities, and elevated blood urea nitrogen. Pancreaticobiliary or liver disease is suggested by elevated pancreatic or liver chemistries. Thyroid chemistries, cortisol, and calcium levels are obtained to exclude endocrinologic causes of GI symptoms. Pregnancy testing is considered for women with unexplained nausea. Serologic tests can screen for celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatologic diseases like lupus or scleroderma, and paraneoplastic dysmotility syndromes.', 'Orthostatic hypotension and reduced skin turgor indicate intravascular fluid loss. Pulmonary abnormalities raise concern for aspiration of vomitus. Abdominal auscultation may reveal absent bowel sounds with ileus. High-pitched rushes suggest bowel obstruction, whereas a succussion splash upon abrupt lateral movement of the patient is found with gastroparesis or pyloric obstruction. Tenderness or involuntary guarding raises suspicion of inflammation, whereas fecal blood suggests mucosal injury from ulcer, ischemia, or tumor.

","['Greatly elevated platelet countsdevelop during the subacute phase. The development of coronary artery aneurysms is monitored by performing two-dimensional echocardiograms, usually during the acute phase, at 2 to3 weeks, and again at 6 to 8 weeks. More frequent echocardiograms and, potentially, coronary angiography are indicated forpatients who develop coronary artery abnormalities. The diagnosis of KD is based on the presence of fever for more than 5 days without an identifiable source and the presence of four of five other clinical criteria (Table 88-1). The diagnosis of incomplete (atypical) KD, which occurs more commonly in infants, is made when fever is present for at least 5 days even if only two or three clinical criteria are present, particularly in the presence of coronary artery aneurysms. The diagnosis of KD should be considered in infants younger than 6 months of age with fever for at least 7 days even if no other criteria are present. Because many of the manifestations of KD are found in other illnesses, many diagnoses must be considered and excluded before the diagnosis of KD can be established (Table 88-2). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the mainstay of therapy for KD, although the mechanism of action is unknown.

Aspirin is initially given in anti-inflammatory doses (80 to 100 mg/kg/day divided every 6hours) in the acute phase. Once the fever resolves, aspirin isreduced to antithrombotic doses (3 to 5 mg/kg/day as a single dose) and given through the subacute and convalescentphases, usually for 6 to 8 weeks, until follow-up echocardiography documents the absence or resolution of coronary artery aneurysms. Up to 10% of children with KD initially fail to respondsatisfactorily to IVIG therapy. Most of these patients respondto retreatment with IVIG, but an alternative preparation ofIVIG may be required. Corticosteroids or infliximab arerarely used in KD, as opposed to other vasculitides, but mayhave a role during the acute phase if active carditis is apparent or for children with persistent fever after two doses ofIVIG. Most cases resolve without sequelae. Myocardial infarction has been documented, most likely caused by stenosis of a coronary artery at the site of an aneurysm. Coronary artery aneurysms found on autopsy in older children following sudden cardiac death may have been due to past KD. Other complications are listed in Table 88-3. IVIG reduces the prevalence of coronary artery disease from 20% to 25% in children treated with aspirin alone to 2% to 4% in children treated with IVIG and aspirin. Other than the risk of persistent coronary artery aneurysms, KD has an excellent prognosis. The chronic arthritides of childhood include several types, the most common of which is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), formerly called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).

Available @ StudentConsult.com\n\n\n\nRashes are a common manifestation of many infections; this chapter describes five common childhood viral exanthems characterized by fever and rash. Rash distribution and appearance provide important clues to the differential diagnosis, including other infectious agents (Table 97-1). Measles (rubeola) is highly contagious and is caused by a single-stranded RNA paramyxovirus with one antigenic type. Humans are the only natural host. Measles virus infects the upper respiratory tract and regional lymph nodes and is spread systemically during a brief, low-titer primary viremia. A secondary viremia occurs within 5 to 7 days as virus-infected monocytes spread the virus to the respiratory tract, skin, and other organs. Virus is present in respiratory secretions, blood, and the urine of infected individuals. Measles virus is transmitted by droplets or the airborne route and is highly contagious. Infected persons are contagious from 1 to 2 days before onset of symptoms—from about 5 days before to 4 days after the appearance of rash—and immunocompromised persons can have prolonged excretion of contagious virus. Measles remains endemic in regions of the world where measles vaccination is not available and is responsible for about 1 million deaths annually. Since 2000 there typically have been fewer than 100 cases reported annually in the United States, although outbreaks resulting from imported virus after international travel occur. Infections of nonimmigrant children during outbreaks may occur among those too young to be vaccinated or in communities with low immunization rates. Most young infants are protected by transplacental maternal antibody until the end of their first year. Measles infection is divided into four phases: incubation, prodromal (catarrhal), exanthematous (rash), and recovery. The incubation period is 8 to 12 days from exposure to symptom onset and a mean of 14 days (range, 7 to 21) from exposure to rash onset.

The conjunctiva may reveal a characteristic transverse line of inflammation along the eyelid margin (Stimson line). The classic symptoms of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis occur during the secondary viremia of the exanthematous phase, which often is accompanied by high fever (40° C to 40.5° C [104° F to 105° F]).

Although the small and large intestines both contribute to the development of symptoms, many symptoms of lactase deficiency are related to the interaction of colonic bacteria and nonabsorbed lactose. More rapid small-intes-1937 tinal transit makes symptoms more likely. 4. Colonic compensation by production of SCFAs from nonabsorbed lactose. Reduced levels of colonic microflora, which can follow antibiotic use, are associated with increased symptoms after lactose ingestion, especially in a lactase-deficient individual. Glucose-galactose or monosaccharide malabsorption may also be associated with diarrhea and is due to a congenital absence of SGLT1. Diarrhea develops when individuals with this disorder ingest carbo hydrates that contain actively transported monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, galactose) but not when they ingest monosaccharides that are not actively transported (e.g., fructose). Fructose is absorbed by the brush border transport protein GLUT 5, a facilitated diffusion process that is not Na-dependent and is distinct from SGLT1. In contrast, some individuals develop diarrhea as a result of the consumption of large quantities of sorbitol, a sugar used in diabetic candy; sorbitol is only minimally absorbed because of the absence of an intestinal absorptive transport mechanism for this sugar. Protein is present in food almost exclusively as polypeptides and requires extensive hydrolysis to diand tripeptides and amino acids before absorption. Proteolysis occurs in both the stomach and the small intestine; it is mediated by pepsin, which is secreted as pepsinogen by gastric chief cells, and by trypsinogen and other peptidases from pancreatic acinar cells. The proenzymes pepsinogen and trypsinogen must be activated to pepsin (by pepsin at a pH <5) and to trypsin (by the intestinal brush border enzyme enterokinase and subsequently by trypsin), respectively. Proteins are absorbed by separate transport systems for diand tripeptides and for different types of amino acids—e.g., neutral and dibasic. Alterations in either protein or amino acid digestion and absorption are rarely observed clinically, even in the presence of extensive small-intestinal mucosal inflammation. However, three rare genetic disorders involve protein digestion/absorption: (1) Enterokinase deficiency is due to an absence of the brush border enzyme that converts the proenzyme trypsinogen to trypsin and is associated with diarrhea, growth retardation, and hypoproteinemia. (2) Hartnup’s syndrome, a defect in neutral amino acid transport, is characterized by a pellagra-like rash and neuropsychiatric symptoms. (3) Cystinuria, a defect in dibasic amino acid transport, is associated with renal calculi and chronic pancreatitis. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:\n\n\n\nThe clues provided by the history, symptoms, and initial preliminary observations will serve to limit extensive, ill-focused, and expensive laboratory and imaging studies. For example, a clinician evaluating a patient who has symptoms suggestive of malabsorption and who has recently undergone extensive small-intestinal resection for mesenteric ischemia should direct the initial assessment almost exclusively to defining whether a short-bowel syndrome might explain the entire clinical picture. Similarly, the development of a pattern of bowel movements suggestive of steatorrhea in a patient with long-standing alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatitis should prompt an assessment of pancreatic exocrine function. The classic picture of malabsorption is rarely seen today in most parts of the United States. As a consequence, diseases with malabsorption must be suspected in individuals who have less severe symptoms and signs and subtle evidence of the altered absorption of only a single nutrient rather than obvious evidence of the malabsorption of multiple nutrients. Although diarrhea can be caused by changes in fluid and electrolyte movement in either the small or the large intestine, dietary nutrients are absorbed almost exclusively in the small intestine. Disorders of Absorption\n\n\n\nTherefore, the demonstration of diminished absorption of a dietary nutrient provides unequivocal evidence for small-intestinal disease, although colonic dysfunction may also be present (e.g., Crohn’s disease may involve both the small and large intestines). Dietary nutrient absorption may be segmental or diffuse along the small intestine and is site specific. Thus, for example, calcium, iron, and folic acid are exclusively absorbed by active-transport processes in the proximal small intestine, especially the duodenum; in contrast, the active-transport mechanisms for both cobalamin and bile acids are operative only in the ileum. Therefore, in an individual who years previously has had an intestinal resection, the details of which are not presently available, a presentation with evidence of calcium, folic acid, and/or iron malabsorption but without cobalamin deficiency makes it likely that the duodenum and proximal jejunum, but not the ileum, were resected. Some nutrients—e.g., glucose, amino acids, and lipids—are absorbed throughout the small intestine, although their rate of absorption is greater in the proximal than in the distal segments. However, after segmental resection of the small intestine, the remaining segments undergo both morphologic and functional “adaptation” to enhance absorption. Such adaptation is secondary to the presence of luminal nutrients and hormonal stimuli and may not be complete in humans for several months after resection. Adaptation is critical for the survival of individuals who have undergone massive resection of the small intestine and/or colon. Establishing the diagnosis of steatorrhea and identifying its specific cause are often quite difficult. The “gold standard” remains a timed, quantitative stool-fat determination. From a practical standpoint, stool collections are invariably difficult and often incomplete, as nobody wants to handle stool. A qualitative test—Sudan III staining—has long been available to document an increase in stool fat. This test is rapid and inexpensive but, as a qualitative test, does not establish the degree of fat malabsorption and is best used as a preliminary screening study. Many of the blood, breath, and isotopic tests that have been developed (1) do not directly measure fat absorption; (2) exhibit excellent sensitivity when steatorrhea is obvious and severe but poor sensitivity when steatorrhea is mild (e.g., assays for stool chymotrypsin and elastase, which can potentially distinguish pancreatic from nonpancreatic etiologies of steatorrhea); or (3) have not survived the transition from the research laboratory to commercial application. Nevertheless, routine laboratory studies (i.e., complete blood count, prothrombin time, serum protein determination, alkaline phosphatase) may suggest dietary nutrient depletion, especially deficiencies of iron, folate, cobalamin, and vitamins D and K. Additional studies include measurement of serum carotene, cholesterol, albumin, iron, folate, and cobalamin levels. The serum carotene level can also be reduced if the patient’s dietary intake of leafy vegetables is poor. If steatorrhea and/or altered absorption of other nutrients is suspected, then history, clinical observations, and laboratory testing can help detect deficiency of a nutrient, especially of a fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, E, or K). Thus, evidence of metabolic bone disease with elevated alkaline phosphatase concentrations and/or reduced serum calcium levels suggests vitamin D malabsorption. A deficiency of vitamin K is suggested by an elevated prothrombin time in an individual without liver disease who is not taking anticoagulants. Macrocytic anemia leads to an evaluation for possible cobalamin or folic acid malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia in the absence of occult bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract in either a male patient or a nonmenstruating female patient requires an evaluation for iron malabsorption and the exclusion of celiac disease, as iron is absorbed exclusively in the proximal small intestine. At times, however, a timed (72-h) quantitative stool collection, preferably while the patient is on a defined diet, must be undertaken in order to determine stool fat content and establish the diagnosis of steatorrhea. The presence of steatorrhea then requires further assessment to identify the pathophysiologic process(es) responsible for the defect in dietary lipid digestion/absorption (Table 349-4). Other studies include the Schilling test (Chap. 350e), the D-xylose test, duodenal mucosal biopsy, small-intestinal radiologic examination, and tests of pancreatic exocrine function. This test (Chap. 350e) is performed to determine the cause of cobalamin malabsorption. An understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of cobalamin absorption is very valuable, enhancing comprehension of aspects of gastric, pancreatic, and ileal function. Unfortunately, the Schilling test has not been available commercially in the United States for the past few years. The urinary d-xylose test for carbohydrate absorption provides an assessment of proximal small-intestinal mucosal function. d-Xylose, a pentose, is absorbed almost exclusively in the proximal small intestine. The d-xylose test is usually performed by administering 25 g of d-xylose and collecting urine for 5 h. An abnormal test (excretion of <4.5 g) primarily reflects duodenal/jejunal mucosal disease. The d-xylose test can also be abnormal in patients with blind loop syndrome (as a consequence primarily of an abnormal intestinal mucosa) and, as a false-positive study, in patients with large collections of fluid in a third space (i.e., ascites, pleural fluid). The ease of obtaining a mucosal biopsy of the small intestine by endoscopy and the false-negative rate of the d-xylose test have led to its diminished use. When small-intestinal mucosal disease is suspected, a small-intestinal mucosal biopsy should be performed. Radiologic examination of the small intestine using barium contrast (small-bowel series or study) can provide important information in the evaluation of the patient with presumed or suspected malabsorption. This study is most often performed in conjunction with an examination of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenal bulb. Because insufficient barium is given to the patient to permit an adequate examination of the small-intestinal mucosa, especially in the ileum, many gastrointestinal radiologists alter the procedure by performing either a small-bowel series in which a large amount of barium is given by mouth, without concurrent examination of the esophagus and stomach, or an enteroclysis study in which a large amount of barium is introduced into the duodenum via a fluoroscopically placed tube. In addition, many of the diagnostic features initially described by radiologists to denote the presence of small-intestinal disease (e.g., flocculation, segmentation) are rarely seen with current barium suspensions. Nonetheless, in skilled hands, barium contrast examination of the small intestine can yield important information. For example, with extensive mucosal disease, intestinal dilation can be seen as a dilution of barium from increased intestinal fluid secretion (Fig. 349-3). A normal barium contrast study does not exclude the possibility of small-intestinal disease. However, a small-bowel series remains useful in the search for anatomic abnormalities, such as strictures and fistulas (as in Crohn’s disease) or blind loop syndrome (e.g., multiple jejunal diverticula) and to define the extent of a previous surgical resection. Other imaging studies that assess the integrity of small-intestinal morphology are CT enterography and magnetic resonance enterography. Capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy are other useful aids in the diagnostic assessment of small-intestinal pathology. A small-intestinal mucosal biopsy is essential in the evaluation of a patient with documented steatorrhea or chronic diarrhea (i.e., that lasting >3 weeks) (Chap. 55). The ready availability of endoscopic equipment to examine the stomach and duodenum has led to its almost uniform use as the preferred method of obtaining\n\n\n\nDisorders of Absorption\n\n\n\nFIGURE 349-3 Barium contrast small-intestinal radiologic examinations.

","['Other features depend on location:\n\n\n\nRight-sided lesions: Often bulky, ulcerating masses that lead to anemia from chronic occult blood loss. Patients may complain of weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, weakness, or vague abdominal pain. Obstruction is rare. Left-sided lesions: Typically “apple-core” obstructing masses (see Figure 2.6-5). Patients complain of a change in bowel habits (e.g., ↓ stool caliber, constipation, obstipation), colicky abdominal pain, and/or blood-streaked stools. Obstruction is common. Rectal lesions: Usually present with bright red blood per rectum, often with tenesmus and/or rectal pain. Can coexist with hemorrhoids, so rectal cancer must be ruled out in all patients with rectal bleeding. Order a CBC (often shows microcytic anemia) and stool occult blood. Perform sigmoidoscopy to evaluate rectal bleeding and all suspicious left-sided lesions. Rule out synchronous right-sided lesions with colonoscopy. If colonoscopy is incomplete, rule out additional lesions with an air-contrast barium enema. Determine the degree of invasion in rectal cancer with endorectal ultrasound. Order a CXR, LFTs, and an abdominal/pelvic CT for metastatic workup. Metastases may arise from direct extension to local viscera, hematogenous spread (40–50% go to the liver, but spread may also occur to bone, lungs, and brain), or lymphatic spread (to pelvic lymph nodes).

Red substances in foods, beverages, or medications (such as cefdinir) occasionally can be mistaken for blood. A test for occultblood is worth performing whenever the diagnosis is in doubt.

If the bleeding is GI, it is important to determine the source as high in the GI tract ordistal to the ligament of Treitz. Vomited blood is always proximal. Rectal bleeding may be coming from anywhere in the gut.When dark clots or melena are seen mixed with stool, a higherlocation is suspected, whereas bright red blood on the surface ofstool probably is coming from lower in the colon. When upperGI tract bleeding is suspected, a nasogastric tube may be placedand gastric contents aspirated for evidence of recent bleeding. The location and hemodynamic significance of the bleeding can also be assessed by history and examination. The parents should be asked to quantify the bleeding.

","[""350). Nuchal translucency (NT) evaluation is a component of first-trimester aneuploidy screening, discussed in Chapter 14 (p. 281). It represents the maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucent area between the skin and soft tissue overlying the fetal spine at the back of the neck. NT is measured in the sagittal plane between 11 and 14 weeks' gestation using precise criteria (Table 10-4). When the NT measurement is increased, the risk for fetal aneuploidy and various structural anomalies-in particular heart defects-is signiicantly elevated. Assessment for selected fetal abnormalities in an at-risk pregnancy is done with irst-trimester sonography (see Table 10-2). Research in this area has focused on anatomy visible at 11 to 14 weeks' gestation, to coincide with sonography performed as part of aneuploidy screening. ith current technoloy, it is not realistic to expect that all major abnomalities detectable in the second trimester may be visualized in the irst trimester. Thus, irst-trimester scanning should not replace second-trimester anatomical evaluation (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016)."", 'The importance of a detailed clinical phenotype cannot be overemphasized. This is the step where one should also consider the possibility of genetic heterogeneity and phenocopies. If obvious candidate genes are suggested by the phenotype, they can be analyzed directly. After identification of a mutation, it is essential to demonstrate that it segregates with the phenotype. The functional characterization of novel mutations is labor intensive and may require analyses in vitro or in transgenic models in order to document the relevance of the genetic alteration. Prenatal diagnosis of numerous genetic diseases in instances with a high risk for certain disorders is now possible by direct DNA analysis. Amniocentesis involves the removal of a small amount of amniotic fluid, usually at 16 weeks of gestation. Cells can be collected and submitted for karyotype analyses, FISH, and mutational analysis of selected genes. The main indications for amniocentesis include advanced maternal age (>35 years), an abnormal serum triple marker test (α-fetoprotein, β human chorionic gonadotropin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, or unconjugated estriol), a family history of chromosomal abnormalities, or a Mendelian disorder amenable to genetic testing. Prenatal diagnosis can also be performed by chorionic villus sampling (CVS), in which a small amount of the chorion is removed by a transcervical or transabdominal biopsy. Chromosomes and DNA obtained from these cells can be submitted for cytogenetic and mutational analyses. CVS can be performed earlier in gestation (weeks 9–12) than amniocentesis, an aspect that may be of relevance when termination of pregnancy is a consideration. Later in pregnancy, beginning at about 18 weeks of gestation, percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) permits collection of fetal blood for lymphocyte culture and analysis. Recently, the entire fetal genome has been determined prenatally from cells taken from the mother’s plasma through deep sequencing and the counting of parental haplotypes, or by inferring it from DNA sequences obtained from blood samples from the mother, father, and umbilical cord. These approaches enable screening for clinically relevant and deleterious alleles inherited from the parents, as well as for de novo germline mutations, and they may have the potential to change the diagnosis of genetic disorders in the prenatal setting. In combination with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques, it is even possible to perform genetic diagnoses in a single cell removed from the fourto eight-cell embryo or to analyze the first polar body from an oocyte. Preconceptual diagnosis thereby avoids therapeutic abortions but is costly and labor intensive. It should be emphasized that excluding a specific disorder by any of these approaches is never equivalent to the assurance of having a normal child. Mutations in certain cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 may identify individuals with an increased risk for the development of malignancies and result in risk-reducing interventions. The detection of mutations is an important diagnostic and\n\n\n\nFIGURE 82-15 Approach to genetic disease. prognostic tool in leukemias and lymphomas. The demonstration of the presence or absence of mutations and polymorphisms is also relevant for the rapidly evolving field of pharmacogenomics, including the identification of differences in drug treatment response or metabolism as a function of genetic background. For example, the thiopurine drugs 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine are commonly used cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents. They are metabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme with variable activity associated with genetic polymorphisms in 10% of whites and complete deficiency in about 1 in 300 individuals. Patients with intermediate or deficient TPMT activity are at risk for excessive toxicity, including fatal myelosuppression. Characterization of these polymorphisms allows mercaptopurine doses to be modified based on TPMT genotype. Pharmacogenomics may increasingly permit individualized drug therapy, improve drug effectiveness, reduce adverse side effects, and provide cost-effective pharmaceutical care (Chap. 5). Determination of the association of genetic defects with disease, comprehensive data of an individual’s genome, and studies of genetic variation raise many ethical and legal issues. Genetic information is generally regarded as sensitive information that should not be readily accessible without explicit consent (genetic privacy). The disclosure of genetic information may risk possible discrimination by insurers or employers. The scientific components of the Human Genome Project have been paralleled by efforts to examine ethical, social, and legal implications. An important milestone emerging from these endeavors consists in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), signed into law in 2008, which aims to protect asymptomatic individuals against the misuse of genetic information for health insurance and employment. It does not, however, protect the symptomatic individual.']","['1', '""The main indications for amniocentesis include advanced maternal age (>35 years), an abnormal serum triple marker test (α-fetoprotein, β human chorionic gonadotropin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, or unconjugated estriol), a family history of chromosomal abnormalities, or a Mendelian disorder amenable to genetic testing.""\n2', '""Amniocentesis involves the removal of a small amount of amniotic fluid, usually at 16 weeks of gestation.""\n3', '""Cells can be collected and submitted for karyotype analyses, FISH, and mutational analysis of selected genes.""\n4', '""Prenatal diagnosis can also be performed by chorionic villus sampling (CVS), in which a small amount of the chorion is removed by a transcervical or transabdominal biopsy.""\n5', '""Chromosomes and DNA obtained from these cells can be submitted for cytogenetic and mutational analyses.""']",0.13636363636363635,"['The quad screen is done in the second trimester. Duringthe first trimester, measurement of a fluid collection of the posterior neck of the developing fetus is termed nuchaltranslucency.

This association provided a noninvasive first trimester marker. Once standardization of nuchal translucency measurements was done,the detection rate for aneuploidy approached 70%. Testing for abnormalities with two first trimester analytes, freeβ-HCG and PAPP-A (pregnancy associated plasma protein)has enhanced first trimester screening to a detection rate ofalmost 90%.', 'Abnormalities on prenatal ultrasound are the second most frequent indication for prenatal genetic screening.

The action potential plateau persists as long as the efflux of charge carried mainly by K+ is balanced by the influx of charge carried mainly by Ca++ . The effects of altering this balance are exemplified by the action of the calcium channel antagonist diltiazem in a papillary muscle preparation (see\n\n\n\nFig. 16.7 ). With increasing concentrations of diltiazem, the plateau voltage becomes progressively less positive and the plateau duration diminishes. Conversely, administration of certain potassium channel antagonists prolongs the plateau substantially.

As already noted, the duration of the action potential in ventricular myocytes varies considerably with the location of these myocytes in the ventricular walls (see\n\n\n\nFig. 16.5). The i to and iK currents mainly account for these differences. In endocardial myocytes, in which the duration of the action potential is least, the magnitude of iK is greatest. The converse applies to the midmyocardial myocytes. The magnitude of iK and the duration of the action potential are intermediate for epicardial myocytes. The iK1 current does not participate in the initiation of repolarization because the conductance of these channels is very small over the range of Vm values that prevail during the plateau. However, the iK1 channels contribute substantially to the rate of repolarization once phase 3 has been initiated. As Vm becomes increasingly negative during phase 3, the conductance of the channels that carry the iK1 current progressively increases and thereby accelerates repolarization (see\n\n\n\nFig. 16.3\n\n\n\nRestoration of Ionic Concentrations (Phase 4)\n\n\n\nThe steady inward leak of Na+ that enters the cell rapidly during phase 0 and more slowly throughout the cardiac cycle would gradually depolarize the resting membrane voltage were it not for Na+,K+-ATPase, which is located in the cell membrane (see ). Similarly, most of the excess Ca++ ions that had entered the cell mainly during phase 2 are eliminated principally by a 3Na+-Ca++ antiporter, which exchanges three Na+ ions for one Ca++ ion.

A:Inability to oppose thumb to other digits
B:Flattened hypothenar eminence
C:Inability to adduct the little finger
D:Atrophied adductor pollicis muscle
E:Paresthesia over the thenar eminence
","['A 35-year-old woman comes to her physician complaining of tingling and numbness in the fingertips of the first, second, and third digits (thumb, index, and middle fingers). The symptoms were provoked by arm extension. Local anesthesia was also present around the base of the thenar eminence. The problem was diagnosed as median nerve compression. The median nerve is formed from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus anterior to the axillary artery and passes into the arm anterior to the brachial artery. At the level of the elbow joint it sits medial to the brachial artery, both of which are medial to the tendon of the biceps. In the forearm the nerve courses through the anterior compartment and passes deep to the flexor retinaculum. It innervates most of the muscles of the forearm, the thenar muscles, the two lateral lumbricals, and the skin over the palmar surface of the lateral three and one-half digits and over the lateral side of the palm and the middle of the wrist. In this patient, the median nerve initially was believed to be trapped below the flexor retinaculum (carpal tunnel syndrome). Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common problem in young to middle-aged patients.', 'Treatment of an underlying condition such as arthritis, hypothyroidism and possibly diabetes, is often helpful. Some patients have benefited, paradoxically, from the stopping of corticosteroids or estrogen. Also, some practitioners favor the use of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medication, but we have been generally unimpressed with the results. Most often, splinting and local steroid injections are very satisfactory in the short term, especially if the symptoms are of recent onset. Another less common site of compression of the median nerve is at the elbow, where the nerve passes between the two heads of the pronator teres, or just above that point behind the bicipital aponeurosis. It gives rise to the “pronator syndrome,” in which forceful pronation of the forearm produces an aching pain (see Table 43-8). There is weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis and opponens muscles and numbness of the first three digits and palm. This nerve is derived from the eighth cervical and first thoracic roots. It innervates the ulnar flexor of the wrist, the ulnar half of the deep finger flexors, the adductors and abductors of the fingers, the adductor of the thumb, the third and fourth lumbricals, and muscles of the hypothenar eminence. Complete ulnar paralysis is manifest by a characteristic clawhand deformity; wasting of the small hand muscles results in hyperextension of the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the interphalangeal joints. The flexion deformity is most pronounced in the fourth and fifth fingers, as the lumbrical muscles of the second and third fingers, supplied by the median nerve, counteract the deformity. Sensory loss occurs over the fifth finger, the ulnar aspect of the fourth finger, and the ulnar border of the palm. The ulnar nerve is vulnerable to pressure in the axilla from the use of crutches, but it is most commonly injured at the elbow by fracture or dislocation involving the joint. Delayed (“tardive”) ulnar palsy may occur many months or years after an injury to the elbow that had resulted in a cubitus valgus deformity of the joint. Because of the deformity, the nerve is stretched in its groove over the ulnar condyle and its superficial location renders it vulnerable to compression. A shallow ulnar groove, quite apart from abnormalities of the elbow joint, may expose the nerve to compressive injury from more innocuous situations such as prolonged resting of the arm on the side of a chair or even excessive flexion of the elbow. Anterior transposition of the ulnar nerve is a simple and effective form of treatment for these types of ulnar palsies. Compression of the nerve may occur just distal to the medial epicondyle, where it runs beneath the aponeurosis of the flexor carpi ulnaris (cubital tunnel). Flexion at the elbow causes a narrowing of the tunnel and constriction of the nerve. This type of ulnar palsy is treated by incising the aponeurotic arch between the olecranon and medial epicondyle. Yet another site of ulnar nerve compression is in the ulnar tunnel at the wrist. Prolonged pressure on the ulnar part of the palm may result in damage to the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve, causing weakness of small hand muscles but no sensory loss. This site is most often implicated in patients who hold tools or implements tightly in the hand for long periods (we have seen it in machinists and professional cake decorators). The lesion is localizable by nerve conduction studies. A syndrome of burning pain (causalgia) and associated symptoms (causalgia) may follow incomplete lesions of the ulnar nerve (or other major nerves of the limbs) and is described further on. The twelfth thoracic, first to fifth lumbar, and first, second, and third sacral spinal nerve roots compose the lumbosacral plexuses and innervate the muscles of the lower extremities (Fig.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['syndrome is commonly associated with pregnancy, edema, trauma, OA, inflammatory arthritis, and infiltrative disorders (e.g., amyloidosis). The diagnosis may be suggested by a positive Tinel’s or Phalen’s sign. With each test, paresthesia in a median nerve distribution is induced or increased by either “thumping” the volar aspect of the wrist (Tinel’s sign) or pressing the extensor surfaces of both flexed wrists against each other (Phalen’s sign). The low sensitivity and moderate specificity of these tests may require nerve conduction velocity testing to confirm a suspected diagnosis.', 'Isolated mononeuropathies may cause symptoms beyond the territory supplied by the affected nerve, but abnormalities on examination typically are confined to appropriate anatomic boundaries. In multiple mononeuropathies, symptoms and signs occur in discrete territories supplied by different individual nerves and—as more nerves are affected—may simulate a polyneuropathy if deficits become confluent. With polyneuropathies, sensory deficits are generally graded, distal, and symmetric in distribution (Chap. 459). Dysesthesias, followed by numbness, begin in the toes and ascend symmetrically. When dysesthesias reach the knees, they usually also have appeared in the fingertips. The process is nerve length–dependent, and the deficit is often described as “stocking-glove” in type.

Lateral geniculatebody ■Open-angle glaucoma is much more common in the United States than closed-angle glaucoma. Occurs when the iris dilates and pushes against the lens of the eye, disrupting ﬂow of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber. Pressure in the posterior chamber then pushes the peripheral iris forward and blocks the angle. Risk factors include family history, older age, Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, prolonged pupillary dilation (prolonged time in a dark area, stress, medications), anterior uveitis, and lens dislocation. Hx/PE: Classically presents with extreme eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and vomiting. A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is ↑. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes. Dx: Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Those that resolve may mimic a migraine headache with blurred vision; the distinction is that the headaches and blurred vision are more likely to be triggered by darkness (due to pupillary dilation) rather than by bright lights (migraine). Tx: This is a medical emergency that can cause blindness. Treatment to ↓ IOP may include eyedrops (timolol, pilocarpine, apraclonidine) or systemic medications (oral or IV acetazolamide, IV mannitol). Laser peripheral iridotomy, which creates a hole in the peripheral iris, is curative and may be performed prophylactically. generally occurs bilaterally, ■Flow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork is limited, in- creasing IOP.

In the United States, macular degeneration is the leading cause of permanent bilateral visual loss in the elderly. Risk factors include age > 40 years, African-American ethnicity, diabetes, and myopia. Hx/PE: Usually asymptomatic until late in the clinical course, when patients may begin to notice visual deficits. Should be suspected in patients > 35 years of age who need frequent lens changes and have mild headaches, visual disturbances, and impaired adaptation to darkness. The earliest visual defect is seen in the peripheral nasal fields. Cupping of the optic nerve head is seen on funduscopic exam. Dx: Tonometry, ophthalmoscopic visualization of the optic nerve, and visual field testing are most important. A diseased trabecular meshwork obstructs proper drainage of the eye, gradually increasing pressure and leading to progressive vision loss. Tx: Treat with topical β-blockers (timolol, betaxolol) to ↓ aqueous humor production or with pilocarpine to ↑ aqueous outﬂow. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used. If medication fails, laser trabeculoplasty or a trabeculectomy can improve aqueous drainage. More common among Caucasians, females, smokers, and those with a family history. Presents with painless loss of central vision. Atrophic (“dry”) macular degeneration: Responsible for 80% of cases. Causes gradual vision loss. Exudative or neovascular (“wet”) macular degeneration: Much less common, but associated with more rapid and severe vision damage.

Atrophic AMD:\n\n\n\nNo treatment is currently available, although a combination of vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and zinc) has been found to slow disease progression. An ↑ mortality rate from high doses of vitamin E and an elevated lung cancer incidence among individuals on beta-carotene supplementation may require modification of this regimen for smokers. Exudative AMD:\n\n\n\nVEGF inhibitors have been shown to improve vision (ranibizumab, bevacizumab) or slow visual loss (pegaptanib) in patients with exudative AMD. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, which involves use of a laser to selectively target retinal vessels, may be useful in conjunction with VEGF inhibitors. Occurs in elderly patients and is often idiopathic. Hx/PE:\n\n\n\nCentral retinal artery occlusion: Presents with sudden, painless, unilateral blindness. The pupil reacts to a near stimulus but is sluggishly reactive to direct light. Patients present with a cherry-red spot on the fovea, retinal swelling (whitish appearance to the nerve fiber layer), and retinal arteries that may appear bloodless. Central retinal vein occlusion: Characterized by rapid, painless vision loss of variable severity. A choked, swollen optic disk with hemorrhages, venous stasis retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and edema of the macula may be seen on funduscopic exam. Tx:\n\n\n\nCentral retinal artery occlusion: Intra-arterial thrombolysis of the ophthalmic artery within eight hours of onset of symptoms may produce benefit in some patients, although evidence remains controversial. Other treatments applied but of unclear benefit include increasing IOP through drainage of the anterior chamber or IV acetazolamide.

Gravidity: The number of times a woman has been pregnant. Parity: The number of pregnancies that led to a birth beyond 20 weeks’ gestational age or an infant weighing > 500 g. Developmental age (DA): The number of weeks and days since fertilization. Typically used only in research, as the exact date of fertilization is not commonly known. Gestational age (GA): The number of weeks and days measured from the frst day of the last menstrual period (LMP). GA can also be determined by:\n\n\n\nFundal height: At 20 weeks, the uterus is at the umbilicus and grows approximately 1 cm/week. Quickening, or appreciation of fetal movement: Typically occurs at 17–18 weeks. Fetal heart tones: Can be heard at 10–12 weeks by Doppler. Ultrasound: Measures fetal crown-rump length (CRL) at 5–12 weeks and measures biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC) from 13 weeks. Ultrasound measurement of GA is most reliable during the f rst trimester. Normal Physiology of Pregnancy\n\n\n\nThe normal physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy are graphically illustrated according to system in Figures 2.11-2 and 2.11-3. Nägele’s rule: due date = last menstrual period + nine months + seven days.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0,"['The presenting syndrome may be one of increased intracranial pressure, but more often it takes the form of a combined pituitary-hypothalamic-chiasmal derangement. The symptoms are often subtle and long standing. In children, visual loss and diabetes insipidus are the most frequent findings, followed in a few cases by adiposity, delayed physical and mental development, headaches, and vomiting. The visual disorder takes the form of dim vision, chiasmal field defects, optic atrophy, or papilledema, as emphasized long ago by Kennedy and Smith. In adults, waning libido, amenorrhea, slight spastic weakness of one or both legs, headache without papilledema, failing vision, and mental dullness and confusion are the usual manifestations. One of the most remarkable cases in our experience was a middle-aged nurse who became distractible and ineffective at work and was thought for many months to be simply depressed. Often it is observed that drowsiness, ocular palsies, diabetes insipidus, and', '0 For visual symptoms, a tubular visual field (i.e., tunnel vision).\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the diagnosis of conversion disorder should be based on the overall clinical picture and not on a single clinical finding.\n\n\n\nA number of associated features can support the diagnosis of conversion disorder. There may be a history of multiple similar somatic symptoms. Onset may be associated with stress or trauma, either psychological or physical in nature. The potential etiological rele- vance of this stress or trauma may be suggested by a close temporal relationship. However, while assessment for stress and trauma is important, the diagnosis should not be withheld if none is found.\n\n\n\nConversion disorder is often associated with dissociative symptoms, such as deperson- alization, derealization, and dissociative amnesia, particularly at symptom onset or during attacks.']",['Insufficient Information'],0.0
